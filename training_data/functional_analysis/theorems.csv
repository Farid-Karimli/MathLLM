$$

$$","Once $W$ is chosen, the continuity of $\Lambda$ at 0 shows that $\Lambda V \subset W$ for some neighborhood $V$ of 0.

1.39,A topological vector space $X$ is normable if and only if its origin has a convex bounded neighborhood.,"If $X$ is normable, and if $\|\cdot\|$ is a norm that is compatible with the topology of $X$, then the open unit ball $\{x:\|x\|<1\}$ is convex and bounded.

For the converse, assume $V$ is a convex bounded neighborhood of 0 . By Theorem 1.14, $V$ contains a convex balanced neighborhood $U$ of 0 ; of course, $U$ is also bounded. Define

$$
\|x\|=
\mu(x) \quad(x \in X)

By $(c)$ of Theorem 1.15, the sets $r U(r>0)$ form a local base for the topology of $X$. If $x \neq 0$, then $x \notin r U$ for some $r>0$; hence $\|x\| \geq r$. It now follows from Theorem 1.35 that (1) defines a norm. The definition of the Minkowski functional, together with the fact that $U$ is open, implies that

The set $\{x: \operatorname{Re} \Lambda x<\gamma\}$ is therefore a weak neighborhood of $x_{0}$ that does not intersect $E$. Thus $x_{0}$ is not in $\bar{E}_{w}$. This proves $\bar{E}_{w} \subset \bar{E}$."

Thus $\left\{f\left(x_{n}\right)\right\}$ is Cauchy in $Y$. Our hypothesis implies therefore that $\left\{x_{n}\right\}$ is Cauchy in $X$. Being a closed subset of a complete metric space, $E$ is complete; hence there exists $x=\lim x_{n}$ in $E$. Since $f$ is continuous,

$$
f(x)=\lim f\left(x_{n}\right)=y .

Thus $y \in f(E)$."
3.6,"If $f$ is a continuous linear functional on a subspace $M$ of a locally convex space $X$, then there exists $\Lambda \in X^{*}$ such that $\Lambda=f$ on $M$.","Assume, without loss of generality, that $f$ is not identically 0 on $M$. Put

Theorem 3.5 therefore assures the existence of a $\Lambda \in X^{*}$ such that $\Lambda x_{0}=1$ and $\Lambda=0$ on $M_{0}$.

If $x \in M$, then $x-f(x) x_{0} \in M_{0}$, since $f\left(x_{0}\right)=1$. Hence

1.43,"Suppose $p$ is a seminorm on a vector space $X$ and $N=\{x: p(x)=0\}$. Then $N$ is a subspace of $X$ (Theorem 1.34). Let $\pi$ be the quotient map of $X$ onto $X / N$, and define $\tilde{p}(\pi(x))=p(x)$. If $\pi(x)=\pi(y)$, then $p(x-y)=0$, and since $|p(x)-p(y)| \leq p(x-y)$, it follows that $\tilde{p}(\pi(x))=\tilde{p}(\pi(y))$.

Consequently, $y=T x$, and the closed graph theorem can be applied.

In the context of Banach spaces, Theorem 5.1 can be stated as follows: If $T: X \rightarrow Y$ is linear, if $\left\|x_{n}\right\| \rightarrow 0$ implies that $T x_{n} \rightarrow 0$ weakly, then $\left\|x_{n}\right\| \rightarrow 0$ actually implies that $\left\|T x_{n}\right\| \rightarrow 0$.

Hence $f \rightarrow \sum \hat{f}(n) a(n)$ is a linear functional on $P_{E}$ which is continuous relative to the $L^{1}$-norm. By the Hahn-Banach theorem, this functional has a continuous linear extension to $L^{1}$. Hence there exists $g \in L^{\infty}$

Since $f^{-1}$ is an $n$-tuple of linear functionals on $Y$, the implication $(d) \rightarrow(a)$ in Theorem 1.18 shows that $f^{-1}$ is continuous. Thus $f$ is a homeomorphism."

At least one $n E$ is of the second category in $X$, since this is true of $B$. Since $x \rightarrow n x$ is a homeomorphism of $X$ onto $X, E$ is itself of the second category in $X$. But $E$ is closed because each $\Lambda$ is continuous. Therefore $E$ has an interior point $x$. Then $x-E$ contains a neighbor-
hood $V$ of 0 in $X$, and

In many applications, the hypothesis that $B$ is of the second category is a consequence of Baire's theorem. For example, $F$-spaces are of the second category. This gives the following corollary of the Banach-Steinhaus theorem:"
1.22,Every locally compact topological vector space $X$ has finite dimension.,"The origin of $X$ has a neighborhood $V$ whose closure is compact. By Theorem 1.15, $V$ is bounded, and the sets $2^{-n} V(n=1,2$, $3, \ldots$ ) form a local base for $X$.

Let $Y$ be the vector space spanned by $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{m}$. Then $\operatorname{dim} Y \leq m$. By Theorem 1.21, $Y$ is a closed subspace of $X$.

Since $V \subset Y+\frac{1}{2} V$ and since $\lambda Y=Y$ for every scalar $\lambda \neq 0$, it follows that

so that

V \subset Y+\frac{1}{2} V \subset Y+Y+\frac{1}{4} V=Y+\frac{1}{4} V
$$

If we continue in this way, we see that

$$
V \subset \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(Y+2^{-n} V\right)

Since $\left\{2^{-n} V\right\}$ is a local base, it now follows from $(a)$ of Theorem 1.13 that $V \subset \bar{Y}$. But $\bar{Y}=Y$.

Since $S$ is one-to-one, $x_{0}=0$. But $\left\|x_{n}\right\|=1$ for all $n$, and $x_{0}=$ $\lim \lambda x_{n}$, and so $\left\|x_{0}\right\|=|\lambda|>0$. This contradiction proves (2) for some $r>0$."

Thus $B$ is convex. If $x \in X$ and $s>p(x)$ then $p\left(s^{-1} x\right)=s^{-1} p(x)<1$. This shows that $B$ is absorbing and also that $\mu_{B}(x) \leq s$. Hence $\mu_{B} \leq p$. But if $0<t \leq p(x)$ then $p\left(t^{-1} x\right) \geq 1$, and so $t^{-1} x$ is not in $B$. This implies $p(x) \leq \mu_{B}(x)$ and completes the proof."

(b) $\Lambda$ is bounded.

(c) If $x_{n} \rightarrow 0$ then $\left\{\Lambda x_{n}: n=1,2,3, \ldots\right\}$ is bounded.

(d) If $x_{n} \rightarrow 0$ then $\Lambda x_{n} \rightarrow 0$.

","Assume (a), let $E$ be a bounded set in $X$, and let $W$ be a neighborhood of 0 in $Y$. Since $\Lambda$ is continuous (and $\Lambda 0=0$ ) there is a neighborhood $V$ of 0 in $X$ such that $\Lambda(V) \subset W$. Since $E$ is bounded,
$E \subset t V$ for all large $t$, so that

$$
\Lambda(E) \subset \Lambda(t V)=t \Lambda(V) \subset t W

This shows that $\Lambda(E)$ is a bounded set in $Y$.

Thus $(a) \rightarrow(b)$. Since convergent sequences are bounded, $(b) \rightarrow(c)$.

Assume now that $X$ is metrizable, that $\Lambda$ satisfies $(c)$, and that $x_{n} \rightarrow 0$.

Finally, assume that $(a)$ fails. Then there is a neighborhood $W$ of 0 in $Y$ such that $\Lambda^{-1}(W)$ contains no neighborhood of 0 in $X$.

$$
(K+V) \cap(C+V)=\varnothing
$$

","We begin with the following proposition, which will be useful in other contexts as well:

If $W$ is a neighborhood of 0 in $X$, then there is a neighborhood $U$ of 0 which is symmetric (in the sense that $U=-U$ ) and which satisfies $U+U \subset W$.

To see this, note that $0+0=0$, that addition is continuous, and that 0 therefore has neighborhoods $V_{1}, V_{2}$ such that $V_{1}+V_{2} \subset W$. If

$$
U=V_{1} \cap V_{2} \cap\left(-V_{1}\right) \cap\left(-V_{2}\right)
$$

then $U$ has the required properties.

The proposition can now be applied to $U$ in place of $W$ and yields a new symmetric neighborhood $U$ of 0 such that

$$
U+U+U+U \subset W .
$$

It is clear how this can be continued.

If $K=\varnothing$, then $K+V=\varnothing$, and the conclusion of the theorem is obvious. We therefore assume that $K \neq \varnothing$, and consider a point $x \in K$. Since $C$ is closed, since $x$ is not in $C$, and since the topology of $X$ is invariant under translations, the preceding proposition shows that 0 has a symmetric neighborhood $V_{x}$ such that $x+V_{x}+V_{x}+V_{x}$ does not intersect $C$; the symmetry of $V_{x}$ shows then that

$$
\left(x+V_{x}+V_{x}\right) \cap\left(C+V_{x}\right)=\varnothing

and no term in this last union intersects $C+V$, by (1). This completes the proof.

Since $C+V$ is open, it is even true that the closure of $K+V$ does not intersect $C+V$; in particular, the closure of $K+V$ does not intersect $C$. The following special case of this, obtained by taking $K=\{0\}$, is of considerable interest."

$V_{i}$ be the open ball with center $p_{i}$ and radius $r_{i} / 2$. It is easy to see that $\Omega=\bigcup V_{i}$.

The construction described in Section 1.46 shows that there are functions $\phi_{i} \in \mathscr{D}(\Omega)$ such that $0 \leq \phi \leq 1, \phi_{i}=1$ in $V_{i}, \phi_{i}=0$ off $B_{i}$. Define $\psi_{1}=\phi_{1}$, and, inductively,

Assume $\Lambda$ is bounded and $\phi_{i} \rightarrow 0$ in $\mathscr{D}(\Omega)$. By Theorem 6.5, $\phi_{i} \rightarrow 0$ in some $\mathscr{D}_{K}$, and the restriction of $\Lambda$ to this $\mathscr{D}_{K}$ is bounded. Theorem 1.32, applied to $\Lambda: \mathscr{D}_{K} \rightarrow Y$, shows that $\Lambda \phi_{i} \rightarrow 0$ in $Y$. Thus (b) implies $(c)$.

Hence $(c)$ implies that $\Lambda \phi_{i} \rightarrow 0$ in $Y$, as $i \rightarrow \infty$. Since $\mathscr{D}_{K}$ is metrizable, $(d)$ follows.

To prove that $(d)$ implies $(a)$, let $U$ be a convex balanced neighborhood of 0 in $Y$, and put $V=\Lambda^{-1}(U)$. Then $V$ is convex and balanced.

The linearity of the members of $X^{\prime}$ shows that $\tau^{\prime}$ is translation-invariant. If $\Lambda_{1}, \ldots, \Lambda_{n} \in X^{\prime}$, if $r_{i}>0$, and if

$$
V=\left\{x:\left|\Lambda_{i} x\right|<r_{i} \text { for } 1 \leq i \leq n\right\}
$$

then $V$ is convex, balanced, and $V \in \tau^{\prime}$. In fact, the collection of all $V$ of the form (1) is a local base for $\tau^{\prime}$. Thus $\tau^{\prime}$ is a locally convex topology on $X$.

If (1) holds, then $\frac{1}{2} V+\frac{1}{2} V=V$. This proves that addition is continuous. Suppose $x \in X$ and $\alpha$ is a scalar. Then $x \in s V$ for some $s>0$. If $|\beta-\alpha|<r$ and $y-x \in r V$ then

$$
\beta y-\alpha x=(\beta-\alpha) y+\alpha(y-x)

Hence scalar multiplication is continuous.

We have now proved that $\tau^{\prime}$ is a locally convex vector topology. Every $\Lambda \in X^{\prime}$ is $\tau^{\prime}$-continuous. Conversely, suppose $\Lambda$ is a $\tau^{\prime}$-continuous linear functional on $X$. Then $|\Lambda x|<1$ for all $x$ in some set $V$ of the form (1). Condition (b) of Lemma 3.9 therefore holds; hence so does $(a): \Lambda=\sum \alpha_{i} \Lambda_{i}$. Since $\Lambda_{i} \in X^{\prime}$ and $X^{\prime}$ is a vector space, $\Lambda \in X^{\prime}$.

The converse is the nontrivial part of the theorem.

Suppose $E \subset X$ is weakly bounded and $U$ is an original neighborhood of 0 in $X$.

Since $X$ is locally convex, there is a convex, balanced, original neighborhood $V$ of 0 in $X$ such that $\bar{V} \subset U$. Let $K \subset X^{*}$ be the polar of $V$ :

It is clear that $V$ is a subset of the right side of (2) and hence so is $\bar{V}$, since the right side of (2) is closed. Suppose $x_{0} \in X$ but $x_{0} \notin \bar{V}$. Theorem 3.7 (with $\bar{V}$ in place of $B$ ) then shows that $\Lambda x_{0}>1$ for some $\Lambda \in K$. This proves (2).

Since $E$ is weakly bounded, there corresponds to each $\Lambda \in X^{*}$ a number $\gamma(\Lambda)<\infty$ such that

|\Lambda x| \leq \gamma \quad(x \in E, \Lambda \in K)

E \subset t \bar{V} \subset t U \quad(t>\gamma)

In the rest of the proof we shall deal with individual functions, not with equivalence classes modulo null sets.

Let $\left\{\phi_{1}, \ldots, \phi_{n}\right\}$ be an orthonormal set in $S$, regarded as a subspace of $L^{2}$. Let $Q$ be a countable dense subset of the euclidean unit ball $B$ of $\mathcal{C}^{n}$. If $c=\left(c_{1}, \ldots, c_{n}\right) \in B$, define $f_{c}=\sum c_{i} \phi_{i}$. Then $\left\|f_{c}\right\|_{2} \leq 1$, and so $\left\|f_{c}\right\|_{\infty} \leq M$. Since $Q$ is countable, there is a set $\Omega^{\prime} \subset \Omega$, with $\mu\left(\Omega^{\prime}\right)=1$, such that $\left|f_{c}(x)\right| \leq M$ for every $c \in Q$ and for every $x \in \Omega^{\prime}$. If $x$ is fixed, $c \rightarrow\left|f_{c}(x)\right|$ is a continuous function on $B$. Hence $\left|f_{c}(x)\right| \leq M$ whenever $c \in B$ and $x \in \Omega^{\prime}$. It follows that $\sum\left|\phi_{i}(x)\right|^{2} \leq$ $M^{2}$ for every $x \in \Omega^{\prime}$. Integration of this inequality gives $n \leq M^{2}$. We conclude that $\operatorname{dim} S \leq M^{2}$. This proves the theorem."
6.21,"Suppose $\Gamma$ is an open cover of an open set $\Omega \subset R^{n}$, and suppose that to each $\omega \in \Gamma$ corresponds a distribution $\Lambda_{\omega} \in \mathscr{D}^{\prime}(\omega)$ such that

$$
\Lambda_{\omega^{\prime}}=\Lambda_{\omega^{\prime \prime}} \text { in } \omega^{\prime} \cap \omega^{\prime \prime}
$$

whenever $\omega^{\prime} \cap \omega^{\prime \prime} \neq \varnothing$.

Then there exists a unique $\Lambda \in \mathscr{D}^{\prime}(\Omega)$ such that

$$
\Lambda=\Lambda_{\omega} \text { in } \omega
$$

for every $\omega \in \Gamma$.","Let $\left\{\psi_{i}\right\}$ be a locally finite partition of unity, subordinate to $\Gamma$, as in Theorem 6.20, and associate to each $i$ a set $\omega_{i} \in \Gamma$ such that $\omega_{i}$ contains the support of $\psi_{i}$.

If $\phi \in \mathscr{D}(\Omega)$, then $\phi=\sum \psi_{i} \phi$. Only finitely many terms in this sum are different from 0 , since $\phi$ has compact support. Define

$$
\Lambda \phi=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \Lambda_{\omega_{i}}\left(\psi_{i} \phi\right)
$$

It is clear that $\Lambda$ is a linear functional on $\mathscr{D}(\Omega)$.

To show that $\Lambda$ is continuous, suppose $\phi_{j} \rightarrow 0$ in $\mathscr{D}(\Omega)$. There is a compact $K \subset \Omega$ which contains the support of every $\phi_{j}$. If $m$ is chosen as in part $(c)$ of Theorem 6.20 , then

$$
\Lambda \phi_{j}=\sum_{i=1}^{m} \Lambda_{\omega_{i}}\left(\psi_{i} \phi_{j}\right) \quad(j=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

Since $\psi_{i} \phi_{j} \rightarrow 0$ in $\mathscr{D}\left(\omega_{i}\right)$, as $j \rightarrow \infty$, it follows from (4) that $\Lambda \phi_{j} \rightarrow 0$. By Theorem 6.6, $\Lambda \in \mathscr{D}^{\prime}(\Omega)$.

To prove (2), pick $\phi \in \mathscr{D}(\omega)$. Then

$$
\psi_{i} \phi \in \mathscr{D}\left(\omega_{i} \cap \omega\right) \quad(i=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

so that (1) implies $\Lambda_{\omega_{i}}\left(\psi_{i} \phi\right)=\Lambda_{\omega}\left(\psi_{i} \phi\right)$. Hence

$$
\Lambda \phi=\sum \Lambda_{\omega}\left(\psi_{i} \phi\right)=\Lambda_{\omega}\left(\sum \psi_{i} \phi\right)=\Lambda_{\omega} \phi
$$

which proves (2).

This gives the existence of $\Lambda$. The uniqueness is trivial since (2) (with $\omega_{i}$ in place of $\omega$ ) implies that $\Lambda$ must satisfy (3)."

Suppose $x \in \bar{Y}$, and define

$$
E_{n}=Y \cap\left(x+V_{n}\right) \quad(n=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

If $y_{1} \in E_{n}$ and $y_{2} \in E_{n}$, then $y_{1}-y_{2}$ lies in $Y$ and also in $V_{n}+V_{n} \subset$ $U_{n}$, hence in $B_{1 / n}$. The diameters of the sets $E_{n}$ therefore tend to 0 . Since each $E_{n}$ is nonempty and since $Y$ is complete, it follows that the $Y$-closures of the sets $E_{n}$ have exactly one point $y_{0}$ in common.

Let $W$ be a neighborhood of 0 in $X$, and define

$$
F_{n}=Y \cap\left(x+W \cap V_{n}\right)
$$

The preceding argument shows that the $Y$-closures of the sets $F_{n}$ have one common point $y_{W}$. But $F_{n} \subset E_{n}$. Hence $y_{W}=y_{0}$. Since $F_{n} \subset$ $x+W$, it follows that $y_{0}$ lies in the $X$-closure of $x+W$, for every $W$. This implies $y_{0}=x$. Thus $x \in Y$. This proves that $\bar{Y}=Y$."

Fix such a $\psi$; call its support $K$. By Theorem 6.8, there exist $c_{1}$ and $N$ such that $|\Lambda \phi| \leq c_{1}\|\phi\|_{N}$ for all $\phi \in \mathscr{D}_{K}$.

defines an extension of $\Lambda$. This extension is continuous, for if $f_{i} \rightarrow 0$ in $C^{\infty}(\Omega)$, then each derivative of $f_{i}$ tends to 0 , uniformly on compact subsets of $\Omega$; the Leibniz formula shows therefore that $\psi f_{i} \rightarrow 0$ in $\mathscr{D}(\Omega)$; since $\Lambda \in \mathscr{D}^{\prime}(\Omega)$, it follows that $\Lambda f_{i} \rightarrow 0$.

If $f \in C^{\infty}(\Omega)$ and if $K_{0}$ is any compact subset of $\Omega$, there exists $\phi \in \mathscr{D}(\Omega)$ such that $\phi=f$ on $K_{0}$.

unique complex-linear functional on $X$ whose real part is $\Lambda_{1}$, then $\Lambda \in X^{*}$. (See Section 3.1.) Assume real scalars.

(a) Fix $A_{0} \in A, b_{0} \in B$. Put $x_{0}=b_{0}-a_{0}$; put $C=A-B+x_{0}$. Then $C$ is a convex neighborhood of 0 in $X$. Let $p$ be the Minkowski functional of $C$. By Theorem 1.35, $p$ satisfies hypothesis $(b)$ of Theorem 3.2. Since $A \cap B=\varnothing, x_{0} \notin C$, and so $p\left(x_{0}\right) \geq 1$.

Define $f\left(t x_{0}\right)=t$ on the subspace $M$ of $X$ generated by $x_{0}$. If $t \geq 0$ then

$$
f\left(t x_{0}\right)=t \leq t p\left(x_{0}\right)=p\left(t x_{0}\right)

if $t<0$ then $f\left(t x_{0}\right)<0 \leq p\left(t x_{0}\right)$. Thus $f \leq p$ on $M$. By Theorem 3.2, $f$ extends to a linear functional $\Lambda$ on $X$ that also satisfies $\Lambda \leq p$. In particular, $\Lambda \leq 1$ on $C$, hence $\Lambda \geq-1$ on $-C$, so that $|\Lambda| \leq 1$ on the neighborhood $C \cap(-C)$ of 0 . By Theorem 1.18, $\Lambda \in X^{*}$.

Each $\mu_{i}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $\sigma$. The RadonNikodym theorem [23] shows therefore that there are functions $h_{i} \in L^{1}(\sigma)$ such that $d \mu_{i}=h_{i} d \sigma(1 \leq i \leq n)$. Hence $\Lambda$ is a weak*continuous linear mapping of $L^{\infty}(\sigma)$ into $R^{n}$; recall that $L^{\infty}(\sigma)=L^{1}(\sigma)^{*}$. Put

$$
K=\left\{g \in L^{\infty}(\sigma): 0 \leq g \leq 1\right\}

$$
0 \leq \int f g d \sigma \leq \int f d \sigma

for every nonnegative $f \in L^{1}(\sigma), K$ is weak*-closed. And since $K$ lies in the closed unit ball of $L^{\infty}(\sigma)$, the Banach-Alaoglu theorem shows that $K$ is weak*-compact. Hence $\Lambda(K)$ is a compact convex set in $R^{n}$.

We shall prove that $\mu(\mathfrak{M})=\Lambda(K)$.

If $\chi_{E}$ is the characteristic function of a set $E \in \mathfrak{M}$, then $\chi_{E} \in K$ and $\mu(E)=\Lambda g$. Thus $\mu(\mathfrak{M}) \subset \Lambda(K)$. To obtain the opposite inclusion, pick a point $p \in \Lambda(K)$ and define

$$
K_{p}=\{g \in K: \Lambda g=p\}
$$

We have to show that $K_{p}$ contains some $\chi_{E}$, for then $p=\mu(E)$.

Note that $K_{p}$ is convex; since $\Lambda$ is continuous, $K_{p}$ is weak*compact. By the Krein-Milman theorem, $K_{p}$ has an extreme point.

Suppose $g_{0} \in K_{p}$ and $g_{0}$ is not a characteristic function in $L^{\infty}(\sigma)$. Then there is a set $E \in \mathfrak{M}$ and an $r>0$ such that $\sigma(E)>0$ and $r \leq$ $g_{0} \leq 1-r$ on $E$. Put $Y=\chi_{E} \cdot L^{\infty}(\sigma)$. Since $\sigma(E)>0$ and $\sigma$ is nonatomic, $\operatorname{dim} Y>n$. Hence there exists $g \in Y$, not the zero element of $L^{\infty}(\sigma)$, such that $\Lambda g=0$, and such that $-r<g<r$. It follows that $g_{0}+g$ and $g_{0}-g$ are in $K_{p}$. Thus $g_{0}$ is not an extreme point of $K_{p}$.

Every extreme point of $K_{p}$ is therefore a characteristic function. This completes the proof."

Fix $m^{*} \in M^{*}$. If $x^{*} \in X^{*}$ extends $m^{*}$, it is obvious that $\left\|m^{*}\right\| \leq\left\|x^{*}\right\|$. The greatest lower bound of the numbers $\left\|x^{*}\right\|$ so obtained is $\left\|x^{*}+M^{\perp}\right\|$, by the definition of the quotient norm. Hence

Since $x$ is not in $V(p, n)$ if $n p(x)>1$, we see that 0 is not in the neighborhood $x-V(p, n)$ of $x$, so that $x$ is not in the closure of $\{0\}$. Thus $\{0\}$ is a closed set, and since $\tau$ is translation-invariant, every point of $X$ is a closed set.

Next we show that addition and scalar multiplication are continuous. Let $U$ be a neighborhood of 0 in $X$. Then

$$
U \supset V\left(p_{1}, n_{1}\right) \cap \cdots \cap V\left(p_{m}, n_{m}\right)
$$

for some $p_{1}, \ldots, p_{m} \in \mathscr{P}$ and some positive integers $n_{1}, \ldots, n_{m}$. Put

$$
V=V\left(p_{1}, 2 n_{1}\right) \cap \cdots \cap V\left(p_{m}, 2 n_{m}\right)
$$

Since every $p \in \mathscr{P}$ is subadditive, $V+V \subset U$. This proves that addition is continuous.

Suppose now that $x \in X, \alpha$ is a scalar, and $U$ and $V$ are as above. Then $x \in s V$ for some $s>0$. Put $t=s /(1+|\alpha| s)$. If $y \in x+t V$ and $|\beta-\alpha|<1 / s$, then

$$
\beta y-\alpha x=\beta(y-x)+(\beta-\alpha) x
$$

which lies in

$$
|\beta| t V+|\beta-\alpha| s V \subset V+V \subset U
$$

since $|\beta| t \leq 1$ and $V$ is balanced. This proves that scalar multiplication is continuous.

Thus $X$ is a locally convex space. The definition of $V(p, n)$ shows that every $p \in \mathscr{P}$ is continuous at 0 . Hence $p$ is continuous on $X$, by (b) of Theorem 1.34.

Finally, suppose $E \subset X$ is bounded. Fix $p \in \mathscr{P}$. Since $V(p, 1)$ is a neighborhood of $0, E \subset k V(p, 1)$ for some $k<\infty$. Hence $p(x)<k$ for every $x \in E$. It follows that every $p \in \mathscr{P}$ is bounded on $E$.

Conversely, suppose $E$ satisfies this condition, $U$ is a neighborhood of 0 , and (1) holds. There are numbers $M_{i}<\infty$ such that $p_{i}<$ $M_{i}$ on $E(1 \leq i \leq m)$. If $n>M_{i} n_{i}$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$, it follows that $E \subset n U$, so that $E$ is bounded."

It follows that the compact operators form a subspace $\Sigma$ of $\mathscr{B}(X, Y)$. To complete the proof of $(c)$, we now show that $\Sigma$ is closed. Let $T \in$ $\mathscr{B}(X, Y)$ be the closure of $\Sigma$, choose $r>0$, and let $U$ be the open unit ball in $X$. There exists $S \in \Sigma$ with $\|S-T\|<r$. Since $S(U)$ is totally bounded, there are points $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}$ in $U$ such that $S(U)$ is covered by the balls of radius $r$ with centers at the points $S x_{i}$. Since
$\|S x-T x\|<r$ for every $x \in U$, it follows that $T(U)$ is covered by the balls of radius $3 r$ with centers at the points $T x_{i}$. Thus $T(U)$ is totally bounded, which proves that $T \in \Sigma$."

4.14,"If $X$ and $Y$ are Banach spaces and if $T \in \mathscr{B}(X, Y)$, then each of the following three conditions implies the other two:

(a) $\mathscr{R}(T)$ is closed in $Y$.

(b) $\mathscr{R}\left(T^{*}\right)$ is weak*-closed in $X^{*}$.

(c) $\mathscr{R}\left(T^{*}\right)$ is norm-closed in $X^{*}$.

","It is obvious that $(b)$ implies $(c)$. We will prove that $(a)$ implies $(b)$ and that $(c)$ implies $(a)$.

Suppose $(a)$ holds. By Theorem 4.12 and $(b)$ of Theorem 4.7, $\mathscr{N}(T)^{\perp}$ is the weak*-closure of $\mathscr{R}\left(T^{*}\right)$. To prove $(b)$ it is therefore enough to show that $\mathscr{N}(T)^{\perp} \subset \mathscr{R}\left(T^{*}\right)$.

Pick $x^{*} \in \mathscr{N}(T)^{\perp}$. Define a linear functional $\Lambda$ on $\mathscr{R}(T)$ by

$$
\Lambda T x=\left\langle x, x^{*}\right\rangle \quad(x \in X)
$$

Note that $\Lambda$ is well defined, for if $T x=T x^{\prime}$, then $x-x^{\prime} \in \mathcal{N}(T)$; hence

$$
\left\langle x-x^{\prime}, x^{*}\right\rangle=0 .
$$

The open mapping theorem applies to

$$
T: X \rightarrow \mathscr{R}(T)
$$

since $\mathscr{R}(T)$ is assumed to be a closed subspace of the complete space $Y$ and is therefore complete. It follows that there exists $K<\infty$ such that to each $y \in \mathscr{R}(T)$ corresponds an $x \in X$ with $T x=y,\|x\| \leq K\|y\|$, and

$$
|\Lambda y|=|\Lambda T x|=\left|\left\langle x, x^{*}\right\rangle\right| \leq K\|y\|\left\|x^{*}\right\| .
$$

Thus $\Lambda$ is continuous. By the Hahn-Banach theorem, some $y^{*} \in Y^{*}$ extends $\Lambda$. Hence

$$
\left\langle T x, y^{*}\right\rangle=\Lambda T x=\left\langle x, x^{*}\right\rangle \quad(x \in X) .
$$

This implies $x^{*}=T^{*} y^{*}$. Since $x^{*}$ was an arbitrary element of $\mathcal{N}(T)^{\perp}$, we have shown that $\mathscr{N}(T)^{\perp} \subset \mathscr{R}\left(T^{*}\right)$. Thus $(b)$ follows from $(a)$.

Suppose next that (c) holds. Let $Z$ be the closure of $\mathscr{R}(T)$ in $Y$. Define $S \in \mathscr{B}(X, Z)$ by setting $S x=T x$. Since $\mathscr{R}(S)$ is dense in $Z$, Corollary $(b)$ to Theorem 4.12 implies that

$$
S^{*}: Z^{*} \rightarrow X^{*}
$$

is one-to-one.

If $z^{*} \in Z^{*}$, the Hahn-Banach theorem furnishes an extension $y^{*}$ of $z^{*}$; for every $x \in X$,

$$
\left\langle x, T^{*} y^{*}\right\rangle=\left\langle T x, y^{*}\right\rangle=\left\langle S x, z^{*}\right\rangle=\left\langle x, S^{*} z^{*}\right\rangle .
$$

Hence $S^{*} z^{*}=T^{*} y^{*}$. It follows that $S^{*}$ and $T^{*}$ have identical ranges. Since $(c)$ is assumed to hold, $\mathscr{R}\left(S^{*}\right)$ is closed, hence complete.

Apply the open mapping theorem to

$$
S^{*}: Z^{*} \rightarrow \mathscr{R}\left(S^{*}\right)
$$

Since $S^{*}$ is one-to-one, the conclusion is that there is a constant $c>0$ which satisfies

$$
c\left\|z^{*}\right\| \leq\left\|S^{*} z^{*}\right\|
$$

for every $z^{*} \in Z^{*}$. Hence $S: X \rightarrow Z$ is an open mapping, by Theorem 4.13. In particular, $S(X)=Z$. But $\mathscr{R}(T)=\mathscr{R}(S)$, by the definition of $S$. Thus $\mathscr{R}(T)=Z$, a closed subspace of $Y$.

This completes the proof that $(c)$ implies $(a)$."

13.25,"In the situation of Theorem $13.24, \mathscr{D}_{f}=H$ if and only if $f \in L^{\infty}(E)$.","Assume $\mathscr{D}_{f}=H$.

If $f_{n}=f \phi_{n}$ is a truncation of $f$, it follows from the multiplication theorem, combined with Theorem 12.21 , that

$$
\left\|f_{n}\right\|_{\infty}=\left\|\Psi\left(f_{n}\right)\right\|=\left\|\Psi(f) \Psi\left(\phi_{n}\right)\right\| \leq\|\Psi(f)\|,
$$

since $\left\|\Psi\left(\phi_{n}\right)\right\|=\left\|\phi_{n}\right\|_{\infty} \leq 1$. Thus $\|f\|_{\infty} \leq\|\Psi(f)\|$, and $f \in L^{\infty}(E)$. The converse is contained in Theorem 12.21."
3.2,"Suppose

(a) $M$ is a subspace of a real vector space $X$,

(b) $p: X \rightarrow R$ satisfies

$$

$$

if $x \in X, y \in X, t \geq 0$,

(c) $f: M \rightarrow R$ is linear and $f(x) \leq p(x)$ on $M$.

Then there exists a linear $\Lambda: X \rightarrow R$ such that

$$
\Lambda x=f(x) \quad(x \in M)
$$

and

$$
-p(-x) \leq \Lambda x \leq p(x) \quad(x \in X)

","If $M \neq X$, choose $x_{1} \in X, x_{1} \notin M$, and define

$$
M_{1}=\left\{x+t x_{1}: x \in M, t \in R\right\}
$$

It is clear that $M_{1}$ is a vector space. Since

$$
f(x)+f(y)=f(x+y) \leq p(x+y) \leq p\left(x-x_{1}\right)+p\left(x_{1}+y\right)
$$

we have

$$
f(x)-p\left(x-x_{1}\right) \leq p\left(y+x_{1}\right)-f(y) \quad(x, y \in M)
$$

Let $\alpha$ be the least upper bound of the left side of (1), as $x$ ranges over $M$. Then

$$
f(x)-\alpha \leq p\left(x-x_{1}\right) \quad(x \in M)
$$

and

$$
f(y)+\alpha \leq p\left(y+x_{1}\right) \quad(y \in M) .
$$

Define $f_{1}$ on $M_{1}$ by

Then $f_{1}=f$ on $M$, and $f_{1}$ is linear on $M_{1}$.

$$
f_{1}\left(x+t x_{1}\right)=f(x)+t \alpha \quad(x \in M, t \in R) .
$$

Take $t>0$, replace $x$ by $t^{-1} x$ in (2), replace $y$ by $t^{-1} y$ in (3), and multiply the resulting inequalities by $t$. In combination with (4), this proves that $f_{1} \leq p$ on $M_{1}$.

The second part of the proof can be done by whatever one's favorite method of transfinite induction is; one can use well-ordering, or Zorn's lemma, or Hausdorff's maximality theorem.

Let $\mathscr{P}$ be the collection of all ordered pairs $\left(M^{\prime}, f^{\prime}\right)$, where $M^{\prime}$ is a subspace of $X$ that contains $M$ and $f^{\prime}$ is a linear functional on $M^{\prime}$ that extends $f$ and satisfies $f^{\prime} \leq p$ on $M^{\prime}$. Partially order $\mathscr{P}$ by declaring $\left(M^{\prime}, f^{\prime}\right) \leq\left(M^{\prime \prime}, f^{\prime \prime}\right)$ to mean that $M^{\prime} \subset M^{\prime \prime}$ and $f^{\prime \prime}=f^{\prime}$ on $M^{\prime}$. By Hausdorff's maximality theorem there exists a maximal totally ordered subcollection $\Omega$ of $\mathscr{P}$.

Let $\Phi$ be the collection of all $M^{\prime}$ such that $\left(M^{\prime}, f^{\prime}\right) \in \Omega$. Then $\Phi$ is totally ordered by set inclusion, and the union $\tilde{M}$ of all members of $\Phi$ is therefore a subspace of $X$. If $x \in \tilde{M}$ then $x \in M^{\prime}$ for some $M^{\prime} \in \Phi$; define $\Lambda x=f^{\prime}(x)$, where $f^{\prime}$ is the function which occurs in the pair $\left(M^{\prime}, f^{\prime}\right) \in \Omega$.

It is now easy to check that $\Lambda$ is well defined on $\tilde{M}$, that $\Lambda$ is linear, and that $\Lambda \leq p$. If $\tilde{M}$ were a proper subspace of $X$, the first part of the proof would give a further extension of $\Lambda$, and this would contradict the maximality of $\Omega$. Thus $\tilde{M}=X$.

Finally, the inequality $\Lambda \leq p$ implies that

$$
-p(-x) \leq-\Lambda(-x)=\Lambda x
$$

for all $x \in X$. This completes the proof."
4.13,"Let $U$ and $V$ be the open unit balls in the Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$, respectively. If $T \in \mathscr{B}(X, Y)$ and $\delta>0$, then the implications

$$

hold among the following statements:

(a) $\left\|T^{*} y^{*}\right\| \geq \delta\left\|y^{*}\right\|$ for every $y^{*} \in Y^{*}$.

(b) $\overline{T(U)} \supset \delta V$.

(c) $T(U) \supset \delta V$.

(d) $T(X)=Y$.

Moreover, if (d) holds, then (a) holds for some $\delta>0$.","Assume $(a)$, and pick $y_{0} \notin \overline{T(U)}$. Since $\overline{T(U)}$ is convex, closed, and balanced, Theorem 3.7 shows that there is a $y^{*}$ such that $\left|\left\langle y, y^{*}\right\rangle\right| \leq 1$ for every $y \in \overline{T(U)}$, but $\left|\left\langle y_{0}, y^{*}\right\rangle\right|>1$. If $x \in U$, it follows that

$$
\left|\left\langle x, T^{*} y^{*}\right\rangle\right|=\left|\left\langle T x, y^{*}\right\rangle\right| \leq 1
$$

Thus $\left\|T^{*} y^{*}\right\| \leq 1$, and now (a) gives

$$
\delta<\delta\left|\left\langle y_{0}, y^{*}\right\rangle\right| \leq \delta\left\|y_{0}\right\|\left\|y^{*}\right\| \leq\left\|y_{0}\right\|\left\|T^{*} y^{*}\right\| \leq\left\|y_{0}\right\| \text {. }
$$

It follows that $y \in \overline{T(U)}$ if $\|y\| \leq \delta$. Thus $(a) \rightarrow(b)$.

Next, assume $(b)$. Take $\delta=1$, without loss of generality. Then $\overline{T(U)} \supset \bar{V}$. To every $y \in Y$ and every $\varepsilon>0$ corresponds therefore an $x \in X$ with $\|x\| \leq\|y\|$ and $\|y-T x\|<\varepsilon$.

Pick $y_{1} \in V$. Pick $\varepsilon_{n}>0$ so that

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \varepsilon_{n}<1-\left\|y_{1}\right\|
$$

Assume $n \geq 1$ and $y_{n}$ is picked. There exists $x_{n}$ such that $\left\|x_{n}\right\| \leq\left\|y_{n}\right\|$ and $\left\|y_{n}-T x_{n}\right\|<\varepsilon_{n}$. Put

$$
y_{n+1}=y_{n}-T x_{n} \text {. }
$$

By induction, this process defines two sequences $\left\{x_{n}\right\}$ and $\left\{y_{n}\right\}$. Note that

$$
\left\|x_{n+1}\right\| \leq\left\|y_{n+1}\right\|=\left\|y_{n}-T x_{n}\right\|<\varepsilon_{n}
$$

Hence

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left\|x_{n}\right\| \leq\left\|x_{1}\right\|+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \varepsilon_{n} \leq\left\|y_{1}\right\|+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \varepsilon_{n}<1
$$

It follows that $x=\sum x_{n}$ is in $U$ (see Exercise 23) and that

$$
T x=\lim _{N \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=1}^{N} T x_{n}=\lim _{N \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(y_{n}-y_{n+1}\right)=y_{1}
$$

since $y_{N+1} \rightarrow 0$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$. Thus $y_{1}=T x \in T(U)$, which proves $(c)$.

Note that the preceding argument is just a specialized version of part of the proof of the open mapping theorem 2.11.

That $(c)$ implies $(d)$ is obvious.

Assume $(d)$. By the open mapping theorem, there is a $\delta>0$ such that $T(U) \supset \delta V$. Hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left\|T^{*} y^{*}\right\| & =\sup \left\{\left|\left\langle x, T^{*} y^{*}\right\rangle\right|: x \in U\right\} \\

& \geq \sup \left\{\left|\left\langle y, y^{*}\right\rangle\right|: y \in \delta V\right\}=\delta\left\|y^{*}\right\|

\operatorname{co}(E) \subset \operatorname{co}(F)+V .
$$

But $c o(F)$ is compact [a special case of $(a)$ ], and therefore $c o(F) \subset$ $F_{1}+V$ for some finite set $F_{1} \subset X$. Thus

$$
c o(E) \subset F_{1}+V+V \subset F_{1}+U .
$$

Since $U$ was arbitrary, $c o(E)$ is totally bounded."
3.20 (c),"If $X$ is a Fr\'echet space and $K \subset X$ is compact, then $\overline{c o}(K)$ is compact.","Closures of totally bounded sets are totally bounded in every metric space, and hence are compact in every complete metric space (Appendix A4).

Let $K$ be compact, $K \subset R^{n}$. By the proposition that follows, $x \in c o(K)$ if and only if

$$
x=t_{1} x_{1}+\cdots+t_{n+1} x_{n+1}

for some $t \in S$ and $x_{i} \in K(1 \leq i \leq n+1)$. In other words, $c o(K)$ is the image of $S \times K^{n+1}$ under the continuous mapping

1.24,"If $X$ is a topological vector space with a countable local base, then there is a metric $d$ on $X$ such that

(a) $d$ is compatible with the topology of $X$,

(b) the open balls centered at 0 are balanced, and

(c) $d$ is invariant: $d(x+z, y+z)=d(x, y)$ for $x, y, z \in X$.

If, in addition, $X$ is locally convex, then $d$ can be chosen so as to satisfy $(a),(b),(c)$, and also

(d) all open balls are convex.","By Theorem 1.14, $X$ has a balanced local base $\left\{V_{n}\right\}$ such that

$$
V_{n+1}+V_{n+1}+V_{n+1}+V_{n+1} \subset V_{n} \quad(n+1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

when $X$ is locally convex, this local base can be chosen so that each $V_{n}$ is also convex.

Let $D$ be the set of all rational numbers $r$ of the form

$$
r=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_{n}(r) 2^{-n}
$$

where each of the ""digits"" $c_{i}(r)$ is 0 or 1 and only finitely many are 1 . Thus each $r \in D$ satisfies the inequalities $0 \leq r<1$.

Put $A(r)=X$ if $r \geq 1$; for any $r \in D$, define

$$
A(r)=c_{1}(r) V_{1}+c_{2}(r) V_{2}+c_{3}(r) V_{3}+\cdots
$$

Note that each of these sums is actually finite. Define

$$
f(x)=\inf \{r: x \in A(r)\} \quad(x \in X)
$$

and

$$
d(x, y)=f(x-y) \quad(x \in X, y \in X)
$$

The proof that this $d$ has the desired properties depends on the inclusions

$$
A(r)+A(s) \subset A(r+s) \quad(r \in D, s \in D)
$$

Before proving (6), let us see how the theorem follows from it. Since every $A(s)$ contains 0 , (6) imples

$$
A(r) \subset A(r)+A(t-r) \subset A(t) \quad \text { if } \quad r<t .
$$

Thus $\{A(r)\}$ is totally ordered by set inclusion. We claim that

$$
f(x+y) \leq f(x)+f(y) \quad(x \in X, y \in X) .
$$

In the proof of (8) we may, of course, assume that the right side is $<1$. Fix $\varepsilon>0$. There exist $r$ and $s$ in $D$ such that

$$
f(x)<r, \quad f(y)<s, \quad r+s<f(x)+f(y)+\varepsilon
$$

Thus $x \in A(r), y \in A(s)$, and (6) implies $x+y \in A(r+s)$. Now (8) follows, because

$$
f(x+y) \leq r+s<f(x)+f(y)+\varepsilon,
$$

and $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary.

Since each $A(r)$ is balanced, $f(x)=f(-x)$. It is obvious that $f(0)=0$. If $x \neq 0$, then $x \notin V_{n}=A\left(2^{-n}\right)$ for some $n$, and so $f(x) \geq 2^{-n}>0$.

These properties of $f$ show that (5) defines a translation-invariant metric $d$ on $X$. The open balls centered at 0 are the open sets

$$
B_{\delta}(0)=\{x: f(x)<\delta\}=\bigcup_{r<\delta} A(r)
$$

If $\delta<2^{-n}$, then $B_{\delta}(0) \subset V_{n}$. Hence $\left\{B_{\delta}(0)\right\}$ is a local base for the topology of $X$. This proves $(a)$. Since each $A(r)$ is balanced, so is each $B_{\delta}(0)$.

If each $V_{n}$ is convex, so is each $A(r)$, and (9) implies that the same is true of each $B_{\delta}(0)$, hence also of each translate of $B_{\delta}(0)$.

We turn to the proof of (6). If $r+s \geq 1$, then $A(r+s)=X$ and (6) is obvious. We may therefore assume that $r+s<1$, and we will use the following simple proposition about addition in the binary system of notation:

If $r, s$, and $r+s$ are in $D$ and $c_{n}(r)+c_{n}(s) \neq c_{n}(r+s)$ for some $n$, then at the smallest $n$ where this happens we have $c_{n}(r)=c_{n}(s)=0$, $c_{n}(r+s)=1$.

Put $\alpha_{n}=c_{n}(r), \beta_{n}=c_{n}(s), \gamma_{n}=c_{n}(r+s)$. If $\alpha_{n}+\beta_{n}=\gamma_{n}$ for all $n$ then (3) shows that $A(r)+A(s)=A(r+s)$. In the other case, let $N$ be the smallest integer for which $\alpha_{N}+\beta_{N} \neq \gamma_{N}$. Then, as mentioned above, $\alpha_{N}=\beta_{N}=0, \gamma_{N}=1$. Hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
A(r) & \subset \alpha_{1} V_{1}+\cdots+\alpha_{N-1} V_{N-1}+V_{N+1}+V_{N+2}+\cdots \\
& \subset \alpha_{1} V_{1}+\cdots+\alpha_{N-1} V_{N-1}+V_{N+1}+V_{N+1} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Likewise

$$
A(s) \subset \beta_{1} V_{1}+\cdots+\beta_{N-1} V_{N-1}+V_{N+1}+V_{N+1}
$$

Since $\alpha_{n}+\beta_{n}=\gamma_{n}$ for all $n<N$, (1) now leads to

$$
A(r)+A(s) \subset \gamma_{1} V_{1}+\cdots+\gamma_{N-1} V_{n-1}+V_{N} \subset A(r+s)
$$

because $\gamma_{N}=1$."
10.12,"If $A$ is a Banach algebra, then $G(A)$ is an open subset of $A$, and the mapping $x \rightarrow x^{-1}$ is a homeomorphism of $G(A)$ onto $G(A)$.","That $G(A)$ is open and that $x \rightarrow x^{-1}$ is continuous follows from Theorem 10.11.

\begin{aligned}
(\alpha x)^{\wedge}(h) & =h(\alpha x)=\alpha h(x)=(\alpha \hat{x})(h) \\
(x+y)^{\wedge}(h)=h(x+y) & =h(x)+h(y)=\hat{x}(h)+\hat{y}(h)=(\hat{x}+\hat{y})(h)

(x y)^{\wedge}(h)=h(x y)=h(x) h(y)=\hat{x}(h) \hat{y}(h)=(\hat{x} \hat{y})(h) .
$$

Thus $x \rightarrow \hat{x}$ is a homomorphism. Its kernel consists of those $x \in A$ which satisfy $h(x)=0$ for every $h \in \Delta$; by Theorem 11.5 , this is the intersection of all maximal ideals of $A$, that is, $\operatorname{rad} A$."

5.9,"Suppose $Y$ is a closed subspace of $C(S), K$ is a compact subset of $S$, and $|\mu|(K)=0$ for every $\mu \in Y^{\perp}$.

We have to prove that $\rho$ maps the open unit ball of $Y$ onto the open unit ball of $C(K)$.

Consider the adjoint $\rho^{*}: M(K) \rightarrow Y^{*}$, where $M(K)=C(K)^{*}$ is the Banach space of all regular complex Borel measures on $K$, with the total variation norm $\|\mu\|=|\mu|(K)$. For each $\mu \in M(K), \rho^{*} \mu$ is a bounded linear functional on $Y$; by the Hahn-Banach theorem, $\rho^{*} \mu$ extends to a linear functional on $C(S)$, of the same norm. In other words, there exists $\sigma \in M(S)$, with $\|\sigma\|=\left\|\rho^{*} \mu\right\|$, such that

$$
\int_{S} f d \sigma=\left\langle f, \rho^{*} \mu\right\rangle=\langle\rho f, \mu\rangle=\int_{K} f d \mu
$$

for every $f \in Y$. Regard $\mu$ as a member of $M(S)$, with support in $K$. Then $\sigma-\mu \in Y^{\perp}$, and our hypothesis about $K$ implies that $\sigma(E)=\mu(E)$ for every Borel set $E \subset K$. Hence $\|\mu\| \leq\|\sigma\|$. We conclude that $\|\mu\| \leq\left\|\rho^{*} \mu\right\|$. By (b) of Theorem 4.13 , this inequality proves the theorem.

Note: Since $\left\|\rho^{*}\right\|=\|\rho\| \leq 1$, we also have $\|\sigma\| \leq\|\mu\|$ in the preceding proof. It follows that $\sigma=\mu$. Hence $\rho^{*} \mu$ has a unique norm-preserving extension to $C(S)$."
6.28,"Suppose $\Lambda \in \mathscr{D}^{\prime}(\Omega)$. There exist continuous functions $g_{\alpha}$ in $\Omega$, one for each multi-index $\alpha$, such that

(a) each compact $K \subset \Omega$ intersects the supports of only finitely many $g_{\alpha}$, and

(b) $\Lambda=\sum_{\alpha} D^{\alpha} g_{\alpha}$.

If $\Lambda$ has finite order, then the functions $g_{\alpha}$ can be chosen so that only finitely many are different from 0 .","There are compact cubes $Q_{i}$ and open sets $V_{i}(i=1,2,3, \ldots)$ such that $Q_{i} \subset V_{i} \subset \Omega, \Omega$ is the union of the $Q_{i}$, and no compact subset of $\Omega$ intersects infinitely many $V_{i}$. There exist $\phi_{i} \in \mathscr{D}\left(V_{i}\right)$ such that $\phi_{i}=1$ on $Q_{i}$. Use this sequence $\left\{\phi_{i}\right\}$ to construct a partition of unity $\left\{\psi_{i}\right\}$, as in Theorem 6.20; each $\psi_{i}$ has its support in $V_{i}$.

Theorem 6.27 applies to each $\psi_{i} \Lambda$. It shows that there are finitely many continuous functions $f_{i, \alpha}$ with supports in $V_{i}$, such that

$$
\psi_{i} \Lambda=\sum_{\alpha} D^{\alpha} f_{i, \alpha}
$$

Define

$$
g_{\alpha}=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} f_{i, \alpha}
$$

These sums are locally finite, in the sense that each compact $K \subset \Omega$ intersects the supports of only finitely many $f_{i, \alpha}$. It follows that each $g_{\alpha}$ is continuous in $\Omega$ and that $(a)$ holds.

Since $\phi=\sum \psi_{i} \phi$, for every $\phi \in \mathscr{D}(\Omega)$, we have $\Lambda=\sum \psi_{i} \Lambda$, and therefore (1) and (2) give (b).

The final assertion follows from Theorem 6.27."
3.13,"Suppose $X$ is a metrizable locally convex space. If $\left\{x_{n}\right\}$ is a sequence in $X$ that converges weakly to some $x \in X$, then there is a sequence $\left\{y_{i}\right\}$ in $X$ such that

(a) each $y_{i}$ is a convex combination of finitely many $x_{n}$, and

(b) $y_{i} \rightarrow x$ originally.","Let $H$ be the convex hull of the set of all $x_{n}$; let $K$ be the weak closure of $H$. Then $x \in K$. By Theorem 3.12, $x$ is also in the original closure of $H$. Since the original topology of $X$ is assumed to be metrizable, it follows that there is a sequence $\left\{y_{i}\right\}$ in $H$ that converges originally to $x$."
3.15,"If $V$ is a neighborhood of 0 in a topological vector space $X$ and if

$$
K=\left\{\Lambda \in X^{*}:|\Lambda x| \leq 1 \quad \text { for every } \quad x \in V\right\}

then $K$ is weak*-compact.","Since neighborhoods of 0 are absorbing, there corresponds to each $x \in X$ a number $\gamma(x)<\infty$ such that $x \in \gamma(x) V$. Hence

$$
|\Lambda x| \leq \gamma(x) \quad(x \in X, \Lambda \in K) .
$$

Let $D_{x}$ be the set of all scalars $\alpha$ such that $|\alpha| \leq \gamma(x)$. Let $\tau$ be the product topology on $P$, the cartesian product of all $D_{x}$, one for each $x \in X$. Since each $D_{x}$ is compact, so is $P$, by Tychonoff's theorem. The elements of $P$ are the functions $f$ on $X$ (linear or not) that satisfy

$$
|f(x)| \leq \gamma(x) \quad(x \in X) .
$$

Thus $K \subset X^{*} \cap P$. It follows that $K$ inherits two topologies: one from $X^{*}$ (its weak*-topology, to which the conclusion of the theorem refers) and the other, $\tau$, from $P$. We will see that

(a) these two topologies coincide on $K$, and

(b) $K$ is a closed subset of $P$.

Since $P$ is compact, $(b)$ implies that $K$ is $\tau$-compact, and then $(a)$ implies that $K$ is weak*-compact."

$$
b_{n}(x)=B\left(x, y_{n}\right) \quad(x \in X, n=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

Since $B$ is continuous as a function of $y$,

$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} b_{n}(x)=B\left(x, y_{0}\right) \quad(x \in X)
$$

Thus $\left\{b_{n}(x)\right\}$ is a bounded subset of $Z$, for each $x \in X$. Since each $b_{n}$ is a continuous linear mapping of the $F$-space $X$, the Banach-Steinhaus theorem 2.6 implies that $\left\{b_{n}\right\}$ is equicontinuous. Hence there is a neighborhood $V$ of 0 in $X$ such that

$$
b_{n}(V) \subset U \quad(n=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

Note that

$$
B\left(x_{n}, y_{n}\right)-B\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)=b_{n}\left(x_{n}-x_{0}\right)+B\left(x_{0}, y_{n}-y_{0}\right)

If $n$ is sufficiently large, then (i) $x_{n} \in x_{0}+V$, so that $b_{n}\left(x_{n}-x_{0}\right) \in U$, and (ii) $B\left(x_{0}, y_{n}-y_{0}\right) \in U$, since $B$ is continuous in $y$ and $B\left(x_{0}, 0\right)=$ 0 . Hence

$$
B\left(x_{n}, y_{n}\right)-B\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right) \in U+U \subset W

for all large $n$. This gives (1).

If $Y$ is metrizable, so is $X \times Y$, and the continuity of $B$ then follows from (1). (See Appendix A6.)"

where $M$ is a positive integer, so large that $|P(\lambda)|<\varepsilon$ if $|\lambda| \leq \delta$. The polynomial $P$ has $\lambda$ as a factor. Hence $P(T)$ is a compact operator, by $(f)$ of Theorem 4.18. Also, $P\left(\lambda_{j}\right)=f\left(\lambda_{j}\right)$ for $1 \leq j \leq N$. It follows that $|P(\lambda)-f(\lambda)|<2 \varepsilon$ for all $\lambda \in $\sigma(T)$. Hence $\|P(T)-f(T)\|<2 \varepsilon$, and $(c)$ of Theorem 4.18 implies that $f(T)$ is compact."
