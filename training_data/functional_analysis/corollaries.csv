Corollary,Statement,Proof
3.12 (a),For convex subsets of a locally convex space: originally closed equals weakly closed.,The proofs are obvious.
3.12 (b),For convex subsets of a locally convex space: originally dense equals weakly dense.,The proofs are obvious.
3.3,"If $X$ is a normed space and $x_{0} \in X$, there exists $\Lambda \in X^{*}$ such that

$$
\Lambda x_{0}=\left\|x_{0}\right\| \quad \text { and } \quad|\Lambda x| \leq\|x\| \quad \text { for all } x \in X \text {. }
$$

","If $x_{0}=0$, take $\Lambda=0$. If $x_{0} \neq 0$, apply Theorem 3.3, with $p(x)=\|x\|, M$ the one-dimensional space generated by $x_{0}$, and $f\left(\alpha x_{0}\right)=\alpha\left\|x_{0}\right\|$ on $M$."
4.12 (a),$\mathscr{N}\left(T^{*}\right)$ is weak*-closed in $Y^{*}$.,"Recall that $M^{\perp}$ is weak*-closed in $Y^{*}$ for every subspace $M$ of $Y$. In particular, this is true of $\mathscr{R}(T)^{\perp}$. Thus $(a)$ follows from the theorem."
4.12 (b),$\mathscr{R}(T)$ is dense in $Y$ if and only if $T^{*}$ is one-to-one.,"As to $(b), \mathscr{R}(T)$ is dense in $Y$ if and only if $\mathscr{R}(T)^{\perp}=\{0\}$; in that case, $\mathscr{N}\left(T^{*}\right)=\{0\}$."
4.12 (c),$T$ is one-to-one if and only if $\mathscr{R}\left(T^{*}\right)$ is weak*-dense in $X^{*}$.,"Likewise, ${ }^{\perp} \mathscr{R}\left(T^{*}\right)=\{0\}$ if and only if $\mathscr{R}\left(T^{*}\right)$ is annihilated by no $x \in X$ other than $x=0$; this says that $\mathscr{R}\left(T^{*}\right)$ is weak*-dense in $X^{*}$."
6.6,Every differential operator $D^{\alpha}$ is a continuous mapping of $\mathscr{D}(\Omega)$ into $\mathscr{D}(\Omega)$.,"Since $\left\|D^{\alpha} \phi\right\|_{N} \leq\|\phi\|_{N+|\alpha|}$ for $N=0,1,2, \ldots, D^{\alpha}$ is continuous on each $\mathscr{D}_{\boldsymbol{K}}$."
3.18,"If $X$ is a normed space, if $E \subset X$, and if

$$
\sup _{x \in E}|\Lambda x|<\infty \quad\left(\Lambda \in X^{*}\right)
$$

then there exists $\gamma<\infty$ such that

$$
\|x\| \leq \gamma \quad(x \in E)
$$

","Normed spaces are locally convex; (6) says that $E$ is weakly bounded, and (7) says that $E$ is originally bounded."
3.4,If $X$ is a locally convex space then $X^{*}$ separates points on $X$.,"If $x_{1} \in X, x_{2} \in X$, and $x_{1} \neq x_{2}$, apply $(b)$ of Theorem 3.4 with $\boldsymbol{A}=\left\{x_{1}\right\}, \boldsymbol{B}=\left\{x_{2}\right\}$."
1.14 (a),Every topological vector space has a balanced local base.,
1.14 (b),Every locally convex space has a balanced convex local base.,Recall also that Theorem 1.11 holds for each of these local bases.
2.12 (a),"If $\Lambda$ is a continuous linear mapping of an $F$-space $X$ onto an $F$-space $Y$, then $\Lambda$ is open.","Statement $(a)$ follows from Theorem 2.11 and Baire's theorem, since $Y$ is now of the second category in itself."
2.12 (b),"If $\Lambda$ satisfies (a) and is one-to-one, then $\Lambda^{-1}: Y \rightarrow X$ is continuous.",Statement $(b)$ is an immediate consequence of $(a)$
2.12 (c),"If $X$ and $Y$ are Banach spaces, and if $\Lambda: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous, linear, one-to-one, and onto, then there exist positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that

$$
a\|x\| \leq\|\Lambda x\| \leq b\|x\|
$$

for every $x \in X$.",Statement $(c)$ follows from $(b)$
2.12 (d),"If $\tau_{1} \subset \tau_{2}$ are vector topologies on a vector space $X$ and if both $\left(X, \tau_{1}\right)$ and $\left(X, \tau_{2}\right)$ are $F$-spaces, then $\tau_{1}=\tau_{2}$.","Statement $(d)$ is obtained by applying $(b)$ to the identity mapping of $\left(X, \tau_{2}\right)$ onto $\left(X, \tau_{1}\right)$."
12.7,"If $S \in \mathscr{B}(H), T \in \mathscr{B}(H)$, and

$$
(S x, x)=(T x, x)
$$

for every $x \in H$, then $S=T$.",Apply the theorem to $S-T$.
12.4,"If $M$ is a closed subspace of $H$, then

$$
\left(M^{\perp}\right)^{\perp}=M
$$

","The inclusion $M \subset\left(M^{\perp}\right)^{\perp}$ is obvious. Since

$$
M \oplus M^{\perp}=H=M^{\perp} \oplus\left(M^{\perp}\right)^{\perp}
$$

$M$ cannot be a proper subspace of $\left(M^{\perp}\right)^{\perp}$."
