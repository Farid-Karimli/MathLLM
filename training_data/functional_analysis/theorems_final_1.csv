There are neighborhoods $W_{1}$ and $W_{2}$ of $a$ and $b$ such that $W_{1}+W_{2} \subset W$. There exist $x \in A \cap W_{1}$ and $y \in B \cap W_{2}$, since $a \in \bar{A}$ and $b \in \bar{B}$. Then $x+y$ lies in $(A+B) \cap W$, so that this intersection is not empty. Consequently, $a+b \in \overline{A+B}$.",

By the proposition in Section 1.7, $a \bar{Y}=\overline{\alpha Y}$ if $\alpha \neq 0$; if $\alpha=0$, these two sets are obviously equal. Hence it follows from $1.13 (b)$ that  $$ \alpha \bar{Y}+\beta \bar{Y}=\overline{\alpha Y}+\overline{\beta Y} \subset \overline{\alpha Y+\beta Y} \subset \bar{Y} $$  the assumption that $Y$ is a subspace was used in the last inclusion.",

The two sets on the left are open; hence so is their sum. Since every open subset of $C$ is a subset of $C^{\circ}$, it follows that $C^{\circ}$ is convex.",

Hence $\alpha B^{\circ} \subset \alpha B \subset B$, since $B$ is balanced. But $\alpha B^{\circ}$ is open. So $\alpha B^{\circ} \subset B^{\circ}$. If $B^{\circ}$ contains the origin, then $\alpha B^{\circ} \subset B^{\circ}$ even for $\alpha=0$.",

1.14 (a),"In a topological vector space $X$, every neighborhood of 0 contains a balanced neighborhood of 0 .","Suppose $U$ is a neighborhood of 0 in $X$. Since scalar multiplication is continuous, there is a $\delta>0$ and there is a neighborhood $V$ of 0 in $X$ such that $\alpha V \subset U$ whenever $|\alpha|<\delta$. Let $W$ be the union of all these sets $\alpha V$. Then $W$ is a neighborhood of $0, W$ is balanced, and $W \subset U$.",
1.14 (b),"In a topological vector space $X$, every convex neighborhood of 0 contains a balanced convex neighborhood of 0 .","Suppose $U$ is a convex neighborhood of 0 in $X$. Let $A=\bigcap \alpha U$, where $\alpha$ ranges over the scalars of absolute value 1 . Choose $W$ as in part $1.14 (a)$. Since $W$ is balanced, $\alpha^{-1} W=W$ when $|\alpha|=1$; hence $W \subset \alpha U$. Thus $W \subset A$, which implies that the interior $A^{\circ}$ of $A$ is a neighborhood of 0 . Clearly $A^{\circ} \subset U$. Being an intersection of convex sets, $A$ is convex; hence so is $A^{\circ}$. To prove that $A^{\circ}$ is a neighborhood with the desired properties, we have to show that $A^{\circ}$ is balanced; for this it suffices to prove that $A$ is balanced. Choose $r$ and $\beta$ so that $0 \leq r \leq 1,|\beta|=1$. Then  $$ r \beta A=\bigcap_{|\alpha|=1} r \beta \alpha U=\bigcap_{|\alpha|=1} r \alpha U $$  Since $\alpha U$ is a convex set that contains 0 , we have $r \alpha U \subset \alpha U$.

(b) The null space $\mathcal{N}(\Lambda)$ is closed.

(c) $\mathcal{N}(\Lambda)$ is not dense in $X$.

(d) $\Lambda$ is bounded in some neighborhood $V$ of 0 .","Since $\mathscr{N}(\Lambda)=\Lambda^{-1}(\{0\})$ and $\{0\}$ is a closed subset of the scalar field $\Phi,(a)$ implies $(b)$. By hypothesis, $\mathcal{N}(\Lambda) \neq X$. Hence $(b)$ implies $(c)$.  Assume (c) holds; i.e., assume that the complement of $\mathcal{N}(\Lambda)$ has nonempty interior. By Theorem 1.14,  $$ (x+V) \cap \mathcal{N}(\Lambda)=\varnothing $$  for some $x \in X$ and some balanced neighborhood $V$ of 0 . Then $\Lambda V$ is a balanced subset of the field $\Phi$. Thus either $\Lambda V$ is bounded, in which case $(d)$ holds, or $\Lambda V=\Phi$. In the latter case, there exists $y \in V$ such that $\Lambda y=-\Lambda x$, and so $x+y \in \mathcal{N}(\Lambda)$, in contradiction to (1). Thus (c) implies $(d)$.  Finally, if $(d)$ holds then $|\Lambda x|<M$ for all $x$ in $V$ and for some $M<\infty$. If $r>0$ and if $W=(r / M) V$, then $|\Lambda x|<r$ for every $x$ in $W$.

Every $z_{k}$ is a continuous function of $z$. The continuity of $f$ is therefore an immediate consequence of the fact that addition and scalar multiplication are continuous in $X$.",
1.21 (a),"If $n$ is a positive integer and $Y$ is an n-dimensional subspace of a complex topological vector space $X$, then every isomorphism of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ onto $Y$ is a homeomorphism.","Suppose $f: \mathbb{C}^{n} \rightarrow Y$ is an isomorphism. This means that $f$ is linear, one-to-one, and $f\left(\mathcal{C}^{n}\right)=Y$. Put $K=f(S)$. Since $f$ is continuous (Lemma 1.20), $K$ is compact. Since $f(0)=0$ and $f$ is one-to-one, $0 \notin K$, and therefore there is a balanced neighborhood $V$ of 0 in $X$ which does not intersect $K$. The set  $$ E=f^{-1}(V)=f^{-1}(V \cap Y) $$  is therefore disjoint from $S$. Since $f$ is linear, $E$ is balanced, and hence connected. Thus $E \subset B$, because $0 \in E$, and this implies that the linear $\operatorname{map} f^{-1}$ takes $V \cap Y$ into $B$. Since $f^{-1}$ is an $n$-tuple of linear functionals on $Y$, the implication $(d) \rightarrow(a)$ in Theorem 1.18 shows that $f^{-1}$ is continuous.

1.22,Every locally compact topological vector space $X$ has finite dimension.,"The origin of $X$ has a neighborhood $V$ whose closure is compact. By Theorem 1.15, $V$ is bounded, and the sets $2^{-n} V(n=1,2$, $3, \ldots$ ) form a local base for $X$.  The compactness of $\bar{V}$ shows that there exist $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{m}$ in $X$ such that  $$ \bar{V} \subset\left(x_{1}+\frac{1}{2} V\right) \cup \cdots \cup\left(x_{m}+\frac{1}{2} V\right) $$  Let $Y$ be the vector space spanned by $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{m}$. Then $\operatorname{dim} Y \leq m$. By Theorem 1.21, $Y$ is a closed subspace of $X$.  Since $V \subset Y+\frac{1}{2} V$ and since $\lambda Y=Y$ for every scalar $\lambda \neq 0$, it follows that  $$ \frac{1}{2} V \subset Y+\frac{1}{4} V $$  so that  $$ V \subset Y+\frac{1}{2} V \subset Y+Y+\frac{1}{4} V=Y+\frac{1}{4} V $$  If we continue in this way, we see that  $$ V \subset \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(Y+2^{-n} V\right) $$  Since $\left\{2^{-n} V\right\}$ is a local base, it now follows from $(a)$ of Theorem 1.13 that $V \subset \bar{Y}$. But $\bar{Y}=Y$.

(d) all open balls are convex.","By Theorem 1.14, $X$ has a balanced local base $\left\{V_{n}\right\}$ such that  $$ V_{n+1}+V_{n+1}+V_{n+1}+V_{n+1} \subset V_{n} \quad(n+1,2,3, \ldots) $$  when $X$ is locally convex, this local base can be chosen so that each $V_{n}$ is also convex.  Let $D$ be the set of all rational numbers $r$ of the form  $$ r=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_{n}(r) 2^{-n} $$  where each of the ""digits"" $c_{i}(r)$ is 0 or 1 and only finitely many are 1 . Thus each $r \in D$ satisfies the inequalities $0 \leq r<1$.  Put $A(r)=X$ if $r \geq 1$; for any $r \in D$, define  $$ A(r)=c_{1}(r) V_{1}+c_{2}(r) V_{2}+c_{3}(r) V_{3}+\cdots $$  Note that each of these sums is actually finite. Define  $$ f(x)=\inf \{r: x \in A(r)\} \quad(x \in X) $$  and  $$ d(x, y)=f(x-y) \quad(x \in X, y \in X) $$  The proof that this $d$ has the desired properties depends on the inclusions  $$ A(r)+A(s) \subset A(r+s) \quad(r \in D, s \in D) $$  Before proving (6), let us see how the theorem follows from it. Since every $A(s)$ contains 0 , (6) imples  $$ A(r) \subset A(r)+A(t-r) \subset A(t) \quad \text { if } \quad r<t . $$  Thus $\{A(r)\}$ is totally ordered by set inclusion. We claim that  $$ f(x+y) \leq f(x)+f(y) \quad(x \in X, y \in X) . $$  In the proof of (8) we may, of course, assume that the right side is $<1$. Fix $\varepsilon>0$. There exist $r$ and $s$ in $D$ such that  $$ f(x)<r, \quad f(y)<s, \quad r+s<f(x)+f(y)+\varepsilon $$  Thus $x \in A(r), y \in A(s)$, and (6) implies $x+y \in A(r+s)$. Now (8) follows, because  $$ f(x+y) \leq r+s<f(x)+f(y)+\varepsilon, $$  and $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary.  Since each $A(r)$ is balanced, $f(x)=f(-x)$. It is obvious that $f(0)=0$. If $x \neq 0$, then $x \notin V_{n}=A\left(2^{-n}\right)$ for some $n$, and so $f(x) \geq 2^{-n}>0$.  These properties of $f$ show that (5) defines a translation-invariant metric $d$ on $X$. The open balls centered at 0 are the open sets  $$ B_{\delta}(0)=\{x: f(x)<\delta\}=\bigcup_{r<\delta} A(r) $$  If $\delta<2^{-n}$, then $B_{\delta}(0) \subset V_{n}$. Hence $\left\{B_{\delta}(0)\right\}$ is a local base for the topology of $X$. This proves $(a)$. Since each $A(r)$ is balanced, so is each $B_{\delta}(0)$.  If each $V_{n}$ is convex, so is each $A(r)$, and (9) implies that the same is true of each $B_{\delta}(0)$, hence also of each translate of $B_{\delta}(0)$.","In a topological vector space $X$, every neighborhood of 0 contains a balanced neighborhood of 0 .;In a topological vector space $X$, every convex neighborhood of 0 contains a balanced convex neighborhood of 0 .;  ;  ; "

The diameters of the sets $E_{n}$ therefore tend to 0 .

Let $\mathscr{B}$ be the collection of all finite intersections of the sets $V(p, n)$. Then $\mathscr{B}$ is a convex balanced local base for a topology $\tau$ on $X$, which turns $X$ into a locally convex space such that
(a) every $p \in \mathscr{P}$ is continuous, and

(b) a set $E \subset X$ is bounded if and only if every $p \in \mathscr{P}$ is bounded on $E$.","Declare a set $A \subset X$ to be open if and only if $A$ is a (possibly empty) union of translates of members of $\mathscr{B}$. This clearly defines a translation-invariant topology $\tau$ on $X$; each member of $\mathscr{B}$ is convex and balanced, and $\mathscr{B}$ is a local base for $\tau$.  Suppose $x \in X, x \neq 0$. Then $p(x)>0$ for some $p \in \mathscr{P}$. Since $x$ is not in $V(p, n)$ if $n p(x)>1$, we see that 0 is not in the neighborhood $x-V(p, n)$ of $x$, so that $x$ is not in the closure of $\{0\}$. Thus $\{0\}$ is a closed set, and since $\tau$ is translation-invariant, every point of $X$ is a closed set.  Next we show that addition and scalar multiplication are continuous. Let $U$ be a neighborhood of 0 in $X$. Then  $$ U \supset V\left(p_{1}, n_{1}\right) \cap \cdots \cap V\left(p_{m}, n_{m}\right) $$  for some $p_{1}, \ldots, p_{m} \in \mathscr{P}$ and some positive integers $n_{1}, \ldots, n_{m}$. Put  $$ V=V\left(p_{1}, 2 n_{1}\right) \cap \cdots \cap V\left(p_{m}, 2 n_{m}\right) $$  Since every $p \in \mathscr{P}$ is subadditive, $V+V \subset U$. This proves that addition is continuous.  Suppose now that $x \in X, \alpha$ is a scalar, and $U$ and $V$ are as above. Then $x \in s V$ for some $s>0$. Put $t=s /(1+|\alpha| s)$. If $y \in x+t V$ and $|\beta-\alpha|<1 / s$, then  $$ \beta y-\alpha x=\beta(y-x)+(\beta-\alpha) x $$  which lies in  $$ |\beta| t V+|\beta-\alpha| s V \subset V+V \subset U $$  since $|\beta| t \leq 1$ and $V$ is balanced. This proves that scalar multiplication is continuous.  Thus $X$ is a locally convex space. The definition of $V(p, n)$ shows that every $p \in \mathscr{P}$ is continuous at 0 . Hence $p$ is continuous on $X$, by (b) of Theorem 1.34.  Finally, suppose $E \subset X$ is bounded. Fix $p \in \mathscr{P}$. Since $V(p, 1)$ is a neighborhood of $0, E \subset k V(p, 1)$ for some $k<\infty$. Hence $p(x)<k$ for every $x \in E$. It follows that every $p \in \mathscr{P}$ is bounded on $E$.  Conversely, suppose $E$ satisfies this condition, $U$ is a neighborhood of 0 , and (1) holds. There are numbers $M_{i}<\infty$ such that $p_{i}< M_{i}$ on $E(1 \leq i \leq m)$. If $n>M_{i} n_{i}$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$, it follows that $E \subset n U$, so that $E$ is bounded.","Suppose $p$ is a seminorm on a vector space $X$: $p(0)=0$;Suppose $p$ is a seminorm on a vector space $X$: $|p(x)-p(y)| \leq p(x-y)$;Suppose $p$ is a seminorm on a vector space $X$: $p(x) \geq 0$;Suppose $p$ is a seminorm on a vector space $X$: $\{x: p(x)=0\}$ is a subspace of $X$;Suppose $p$ is a seminorm on a vector space $X$: The set $B=\{x: p(x)<1\}$ is convex, balanced, absorbing, and $p=\mu_{B}$;  ;  ; "

Since $\Omega$ contains all $\lambda$ with $|\lambda|>\rho(x)$, an application of (3) of the Cauchy theorem 3.31 shows that the condition $r>\|x\|$ can be replaced in (7) by $r>\rho(x)$.

Since right multiplication is assumed to be continuous, $\tilde{A} \subset \mathscr{B}(A)$, the Banach space of all bounded linear operators on $A$.  It is clear that $x \rightarrow M_{x}$ is linear. The associative law implies that $M_{x y}=M_{x} M_{y}$. If $x \in A$, then  $$ \|x\| = \|x e\| = \left\|M_{x} e\right\| \leq \left\|M_{x}\right\|\|e\| . $$  These facts can be summarized by saying that $x \rightarrow M_{x}$ is an isomorphism of $A$ onto the algebra $\tilde{A}$, whose inverse is continuous.

(See Theorem 4.1.) Once this is done, the open mapping theorem implies that $x \rightarrow M_{x}$ is also continuous. Hence $\|x\|$ and $\left\|M_{x}\right\|$ are equivalent norms on $A$.  Suppose $T \in \mathscr{B}(A), T_{i} \in \tilde{A}$, and $T_{i} \rightarrow T$ in the topology of $\mathscr{B}(A)$.

Since multiplication is assumed to be left-continuous in $A$, it follows that the last term of (4) tends to $T(e) y$. Put $x=T(e)$. Then  $$ T(y) = T(e) y = x y = M_{x}(y) \quad(y \in A) $$  so that $T=M_{x} \in \tilde{A}$, and $\tilde{A}$ is closed.

so that $f=0$. Thus $f \rightarrow \tilde{f}$ is one-to-one.

The asserted continuity follows directly from the integral (2) in Section 10.26, since $\left\|(\lambda e-x)^{-1}\right\|$ is bounded on $\Gamma$. (Use the same $\Gamma$ for all $f_{n}$, and apply Theorem 3.29.)

It remains to be proved that $f \rightarrow \tilde{f}$ is multiplicative. Explicitly, if $f \in H(\Omega), g \in H(\Omega)$, and $h(\lambda)=f(\lambda) g(\lambda)$ for all $\lambda \in \Omega$, it has to be shown that

If $f$ and $g$ are rational functions without poles in $\Omega$, and if $h=f g$, then $h(x)=f(x) g(x)$, and since Theorem 10.25 asserts that $R(x)=\tilde{R}(x)$, (3) holds. In the general case, Runge's theorem (Th. 13.9 of [23]) allows us to approximate $f$ and $g$ by rational functions $f_{n}$ and $g_{n}$, uniformly on compact subsets of $\Omega$. Then $f_{n} g_{n}$ converges to $h$ in the same manner, and (3) follows from the continuity of the mapping $f \rightarrow \tilde{f}$.

Thus $\Gamma(y) \neq\{0\}$ if $y \neq 0$. Moreover,  $$ S(\Gamma(y)) \subset \Gamma(y) $$  for all $y \in X$ and $S \in \Gamma$, simply because $\Gamma$ is closed under multiplication. Thus (1) holds for every $\Gamma(y)$.  If the conclusion of the theorem is false, it follows that $\Gamma(y)=X$ for every $y \neq 0$.  Let us assume this.  Pick $x_{0} \in X$ so that $T x_{0} \neq 0$. Then $x_{0} \neq 0$, and the continuity of $T$ shows that there is an open ball $B$, centered at $x_{0}$, so small that  $$ \|T x\| \geq \frac{1}{2}\left\|T x_{0}\right\| \quad \text { and } \quad\|x\| \geq \frac{1}{2}\left\|x_{0}\right\| $$  for every $x \in B$. Our assumption about $\Gamma(y)$ implies that every $y \neq 0$ has a neighborhood $W$ which is mapped into the open set $B$ by some $S \in \Gamma$. Since $T$ is a compact operator, $K=\overline{T(B)}$ is a compact set. By (5), $0 \notin K$. Therefore there are open sets $W_{1}, \ldots, W_{n}$, whose union covers $K$, such that $S_{i}\left(W_{i}\right) \subset B$ for some $S_{i} \in \Gamma, 1 \leq i \leq n$. Put  $$ \mu=\max \left\{\left\|S_{1}\right\|, \ldots,\left\|S_{n}\right\|\right\} $$  Starting with $x_{0}, T x_{0}$ lies in $K$, hence in some $W_{i_{1}}$, and $S_{i_{1}} T x_{0} \in$ $B$. Therefore $T S_{i_{1}} T x_{0}$ lies in $K$, hence in some $W_{i_{2}}$, and $S_{i_{2}} T S_{i_{1}} T X_{0}$ is back in $B$. Continuing this ping-pong game, we obtain vectors  $$ x_{N}=S_{i_{N}} T \cdots S_{i_{1}} T x_{0}=S_{i_{N}} \cdots S_{i_{1}} T^{N} x_{0} $$  in $B$.

Since $\rho(T)>0, T$ has an eigenvalue $\lambda \neq 0$. The corresponding eigenspace  $$ M_{\lambda}=\{x \in X: T x=\lambda x\} $$  is finite-dimensional; hence $M_{\lambda} \neq X$. If $S \in \Gamma$ and $x \in M_{\lambda}$, then  $$ T(S x)=S(T x)=S(\lambda x)=\lambda S x $$  so that $S x \in M_{\lambda}$. This says that $S\left(M_{\lambda}\right) \subset M_{\lambda}$.

If $x \in A$ and $y \in A$, the assumption $\phi(e)=1$ shows that  $$ x=a+\phi(x) e, \quad y+b+\phi(y) e, $$  where $a \in N, b \in N$. If $\phi$ is applied to the product of the equations (2), one obtains  $$ \phi(x y)=\phi(a b)+\phi(x) \phi(y) $$  The desired conclusion (1) is therefore equivalent to the assertion that  $$ a b \in N \quad \text { if } a \in N \text { and } b \in N \text {. } $$  Suppose we had proved a special case of (4), namely,  $$ a^{2} \in N \quad \text { if } a \in N \text {. } $$  Then (3), with $x=y$, implies  $$ \phi\left(x^{2}\right)=\left[\phi(x)\right]^{2} \quad(x \in A) . $$  Replacement of $x$ by $x+y$ in (6) results in  $$ \phi(x y+y x)=2 \phi(x) \phi(y) \quad(x \in A, y \in A) . $$  Hence  $$ x y+y x \in N \quad \text { if } x \in N, y \in A \text {. } $$  Consider the identity  $$ (x y-y x)^{2}+(x y+y x)^{2}=2\left[x(y x y)+(y x y) x\right] . $$  If $x \in N$, the right side of (9) is in $N$, by (8), and so is $(x y+y x)^{2}$, by (8) and (6). Hence $(x y-y x)^{2}$ is in $N$, and another application of (6) yields  $$ x y-y z \in N \quad \text { if } x \in N, y \in A \text {. } $$  Addition of (8) and (10) gives (4), hence (1).  Thus (5) implies (1), for purely algebraic reasons. The proof of (5) uses analytic methods.  By hypothesis, $N$ contains no invertible element of $A$.

To prove (5), fix $a \in N$, assume $\|a\|=1$ without loss of generality, and define  $$ f(\lambda)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{\phi\left(a^{n}\right)}{n !} \lambda^{n} \quad(\lambda \in \mathscr{C}) $$  Since $\left|\phi\left(a^{n}\right)\right| \leq\left\|a^{n}\right\| \leq\|a\|^{n}=1, f$ is entire and satisfies $|f(\lambda)| \leq$ $\exp |\lambda|$ for all $\lambda \in \mathscr{C}$. Also, $f(0)=\phi(e)=1$, and $f^{\prime}(0)=\phi(a)=0$.  If we can prove that $f(\lambda) \neq 0$ for every $\lambda \in \mathscr{C}$, Lemma 10.8 will imply that $f^{\prime \prime}(0)=0$; hence $\phi\left(a^{2}\right)=0$, which proves (5).  The series  $$ E(\lambda)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{\lambda^{n}}{n !} a^{n} $$  converges in the norm of $A$, for every $\lambda \in \mathscr{C}$. The continuity of $\phi$ shows that  $$ f(\lambda)=\phi(E(\lambda)) \quad(\lambda \in \mathscr{C}) $$  The functional equation $E(\lambda+\mu)=E(\lambda) E(\mu)$ follows from (13) exactly as in the scalar case. In particular,  $$ E(\lambda) E(-\lambda)=E(0)=e \quad(\lambda \in \mathscr{C}) $$  Hence $E(\lambda)$ is an invertible element of $A$, for every $\lambda \in \mathscr{C}$.

Then $y^{2}=x$, by Theorem 10.27. We will prove that $y^{*}=y$.  Since $\Omega$ is simply connected, Runge's theorem furnishes polynomials $P_{n}$ that converge to $f$, uniformly on compact subsets of $\Omega$. Define $Q_{n}$ by  $$ 2 Q_{n}(\lambda)=P_{n}(\lambda)+\overline{P_{n}(\bar{\lambda})} $$  Since $f(\bar{\lambda})=\overline{f(\lambda)}$, the polynomials $Q_{n}$ converge to $f$ in the same manner. Define  $$ y_{n}=Q_{n}(x) \quad(n=1,2,3, \ldots) $$  By (2), the polynomials $Q_{n}$ have real coefficients. Since $x=x^{*}$, it follows that $y_{n}=y_{n}^{*}$.

Let $\pi: A \rightarrow A / R$ be the quotient map.  If $\pi(x)=\pi(y)$ and $z=x-y$, then $z \in R$; hence $z^{*} \in R$ because $\rho\left(z^{*}\right)=\rho(z)=0$ (see Theorem 11.15), and therefore $\pi\left(x^{*}\right)=\pi\left(y^{*}\right)$. This shows that the formula  $$ [\pi(a)]^{*}=\pi\left(a^{*}\right) \quad(a \in A) $$  defines an involution in $A / R$. If $a \in A$ is hermitian, so is $\pi(a)$. Since $\pi$ is continuous, $\pi\left(y_{n}\right) \rightarrow \pi(y)$. Since $A / R$ is isomorphic to $\hat{A}$ (Theorem $11.9), A / R$ is semisimple, and therefore every involution in $A / R$ is continuous (Theorem 11.16). It follows that $\pi(y)$ is hermitian. Hence $\pi(y)=\pi\left(y^{*}\right)$.  We conclude that $y^{*}-y$ lies in the radical of $A$.  By Theorem 11.15, $y=u+i v$, where $u=u^{*}$ and $v=v^{*}$. We just proved that $v \in R$.

Thus $h(x) \neq 0$; hence $h(u) \neq 0$. By Theorem 11.5, $u$ is invertible in $A$. Since $x=x^{*},(6)$ implies that $u v=0$. Since $v=u^{-1}(u v)$, we conclude that $v=0$.

If $\tilde{f}=0$, then

$$
f(\alpha) e=\tilde{f}(\alpha e)=0 \quad(\alpha \in \Omega)

so that $f=0$. Thus $f \rightarrow \tilde{f}$ is one-to-one.

The asserted continuity follows directly from the integral (2) in Section 10.26, since $\left\|(\lambda e-x)^{-1}\right\|$ is bounded on $\Gamma$. (Use the same $\Gamma$ for all $f_{n}$, and apply Theorem 3.29.)

It remains to be proved that $f \rightarrow \tilde{f}$ is multiplicative. Explicitly, if $f \in H(\Omega), g \in H(\Omega)$, and $h(\lambda)=f(\lambda) g(\lambda)$ for all $\lambda \in \Omega$, it has to be shown that

$$

If $f$ and $g$ are rational functions without poles in $\Omega$, and if $h=f g$, then $h(x)=f(x) g(x)$, and since Theorem 10.25 asserts that $R(x)=\tilde{R}(x)$, (3) holds. In the general case, Runge's theorem (Th. 13.9 of [23]) allows us to approximate $f$ and $g$ by rational functions $f_{n}$ and $g_{n}$, uniformly on compact subsets of $\Omega$. Then $f_{n} g_{n}$ converges to $h$ in the same manner, and (3) follows from the continuity of the mapping $f \rightarrow \tilde{f}$.

Since $H(\Omega)$ is obviously a commutative algebra, Theorem 10.27 implies that $\tilde{H}\left(A_{\Omega}\right)$ is also commutative. This may be surprising, because $\tilde{f}(x)$ and $\tilde{f}(y)$ need not commute. However, $\tilde{f}(x)$ and $\tilde{g}(x)$ do commute in $A$, for every $x \in A_{\Omega}$. Hence $\tilde{f} \tilde{g}=\tilde{g} \tilde{f}$, by Definition $10.26(d)$.; The last sentence follows from Theorem 10.25. The integral representation (2) in Section 10.26 makes it obvious that $f \rightarrow \tilde{f}$ is linear. If $\tilde{f}=0$, then

$$
f(\alpha) e=\tilde{f}(\alpha e)=0 \quad(\alpha \in \Omega)
$$

so that $f=0$. Thus $f \rightarrow \tilde{f}$ is one-to-one.

The asserted continuity follows directly from the integral (2) in Section 10.26, since $\left\|(\lambda e-x)^{-1}\right\|$ is bounded on $\Gamma$. (Use the same $\Gamma$ for all $f_{n}$, and apply Theorem 3.29.)

It remains to be proved that $f \rightarrow \tilde{f}$ is multiplicative. Explicitly, if $f \in H(\Omega), g \in H(\Omega)$, and $h(\lambda)=f(\lambda) g(\lambda)$ for all $\lambda \in \Omega$, it has to be shown that

$$
\tilde{h}(x)=\tilde{f}(x) \tilde{g}(x) \quad\left(x \in A_{\Omega}\right) .
$$

If $f$ and $g$ are rational functions without poles in $\Omega$, and if $h=f g$, then $h(x)=f(x) g(x)$, and since Theorem 10.25 asserts that $R(x)=\tilde{R}(x)$, (3) holds. In the general case, Runge's theorem (Th. 13.9 of [23]) allows us to approximate $f$ and $g$ by rational functions $f_{n}$ and $g_{n}$, uniformly on compact subsets of $\Omega$. Then $f_{n} g_{n}$ converges to $h$ in the same manner, and (3) follows from the continuity of the mapping $f \rightarrow \tilde{f}$.

If $x \in A$ is such that $F(x)=0$, then  $$ \left|F_{1}(x)\right|^{2} \leq F_{1}\left(x x^{*}\right) \leq 2 F\left(x x^{*}\right)=2 F(x) F\left(x^{*}\right)=0 $$  by $(b)$ and Theorem 11.31. Thus $F_{1}$ coincides with $F$ on the null space of $F$ and at $e$. It follows that $F_{1}=F$. Hence $(b)$ implies $(c)$.  To show that $(c)$ implies $(a)$, let $F$ be an extreme point of $K$. Either $F(e)=0$, in which case there is nothing to prove, or $F(e)=1$. We shall first prove a special case of $(a)$, namely,  $$ F\left(x x^{*} y\right)=F\left(x x^{*}\right) F(y) \quad(x \in A, y \in A) . $$  Choose $x$ so that $\left\|x x^{*}\right\|<1$. By Theorem 11.20, there exists $z \in A$, $z=z^{*}$, such that $z^{2}=e-x x^{*}$. Define  $$ \Phi(y)=F\left(x x^{*} y\right) \quad(y \in A) $$  Then  $$ \Phi\left(y y^{*}\right)=F\left(x x^{*} y y^{*}\right)=F\left[(x y)(x y)^{*}\right] \geq 0 $$  and also  $$ (F-\Phi)\left(y y^{*}\right)=F\left[\left(e-x x^{*}\right) y y^{*}\right]=F\left(z^{2} y y^{*}\right)=F\left[(y z)(y z)^{*}\right] \geq 0 $$  Since  $$ 0 \leq \Phi(e)=F\left(x x^{*}\right) \leq F(e)\left\|x x^{*}\right\|<1 $$  (4) and (5) show that both $\Phi$ and $F-\Phi$ are in $K$. If $\Phi(e)=0$, then $\Phi=0$. If $\Phi(e)>0,(6)$ shows that  $$ F=\Phi(e) \cdot \frac{\Phi}{\Phi(e)}+(F-\Phi)(e) \cdot \frac{F-\Phi}{F(e)-\Phi(e)} $$  a convex combination of members of $K$. Since $F$ is extreme, we conclude that  $$ \Phi=\Phi(e) F $$  Now (2) follows from (8) and (3).  Finally, the passage from (2) to $(a)$ is accomplished by any of the following identities, which are satisfied by every involution:  If $n=3,4,5, \ldots$, if $\omega=\exp (2 \pi i / n)$, if $x \in A$, and if $z_{p}=$ $e+\omega^{-p} x$, then  $$ x=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{p=1}^{n} \omega^{p} z_{p} z_{p}^{*} $$  The proof of (9) is a straightforward computation which uses the fact that  $$ \sum_{p=1}^{n} \omega^{p}=\sum_{p=1}^{n} \omega^{2 p}=0 $$","Every positive functional $F$ on a Banach algebra $A$ with involution has the following properties: $F\left(x^{*}\right)=\overline{F(x)}$.;Every positive functional $F$ on a Banach algebra $A$ with involution has the following properties: $\left|F\left(x y^{*}\right)\right|^{2} \leq F\left(x x^{*}\right) F\left(y y^{*}\right)$.;Every positive functional $F$ on a Banach algebra $A$ with involution has the following properties: $|F(x)|^{2} \leq F(e) F\left(x x^{*}\right) \leq F(e)^{2} \rho\left(x x^{*}\right)$.;Every positive functional $F$ on a Banach algebra $A$ with involution has the following properties: $|F(x)| \leq F(e) \rho(x)$ for every normal $x \in A$.;Every positive functional $F$ on a Banach algebra $A$ with involution has the following properties: $F$ is a bounded linear functional on $A$.

Put $V=S-S^{*}$, and define  $$ Q=\exp (V)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{n !}\right) V^{n} $$  Then $V^{*}=-V$, and therefore  $$ Q^{*}=\exp \left(V^{*}\right)=\exp (-V)=Q^{-1} $$  Hence $Q$ is unitary. The consequence we need is that  $$ \left\|\exp \left(S-S^{*}\right)\right\|=1 \quad \text { for every } S \in \mathscr{B}(H) $$  If (1) holds, then $M^{k} T=T N^{k}$ for $k=1,2,3, \ldots$, by induction. Hence  $$ \exp (M) T=T \exp (N) $$ or $$ T=\exp (-M) T \exp (N) $$ Put $U_{1}=\exp \left(M^{*}-M\right), U_{2}=\exp \left(N-N^{*}\right)$. Since $M$ and $N$ are normal, it follows from (6) that  $$ \exp \left(M^{*}\right) T \exp \left(-N^{*}\right)=U_{1} T U_{2} $$ By (4), $\left\|U_{1}\right\|=\left\|U_{2}\right\|=1$, so that (7) implies  $$ \left\|\exp \left(M^{*}\right) T \exp \left(-N^{*}\right)\right\| \leq\|T\| $$ We now define  $$ f(\lambda)=\exp \left(\lambda M^{*}\right) T \exp \left(-\lambda N^{*}\right) \quad(\lambda \in \mathscr{C}) $$ The hypotheses of the theorem hold with $\bar{\lambda} M$ and $\bar{\lambda} N$ in place of $M$ and $N. Therefore (8) implies that $\|f(\lambda)\| \leq\|T\|$ for every $\lambda \in \not{C}$. Thus $f$ is a bounded entire $\mathscr{B}(H)$-valued function. By Liouville's theorem 3.32, $f(\lambda)=f(0)=T$, for every $\lambda \in \mathscr{C}$. Hence (9) becomes  $$ \exp \left(\lambda M^{*}\right) T=T \exp \left(\lambda N^{*}\right) \quad(\lambda \in \mathscr{C}) $$ If we equate the coefficients of $\lambda$ in (10), we obtain $M^{*} T=T N^{*$",

Since $\frac{1}{2}\left(x_{n}+x_{m}\right) \in E,\left\|x_{n}+x_{m}\right\|^{2} \geq$ $4 d^{2}$. If $x$ and $y$ are replaced by $x_{n}$ and $x_{m}$ in (1), the right side of (1) tends to $4 d^{2}$. Hence (1) implies that $\left\{x_{n}\right\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $H$, which therefore converges to some $x \in E$, with $\|x\|=d$.

Since every exponential has roots of all orders, it follows that $M$ is not an exponential.","It is clear that (3) defines an inner product that makes $H$ a unitary space. We show now that $H$ is complete. Let $K$ be a compact subset of $D$, whose distance from the complement of $D$ if $\delta$. If $z \in K$, if $\Delta$ is the open circular disc with radius $\delta$ and center $z$, and if $f(\zeta)=$ $\sum a_{n}(\zeta-z)^{n}$ for $\zeta \in \Delta$, a simple computation shows that  $$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(n+1)^{-1}\left|a_{n}\right|^{2} \delta^{2 n+2}=\frac{1}{\pi} \int_{\Delta}|f|^{2} d m_{2} $$  Since $f(z)=a_{0}$, it follows that  $$ |f(z)| \leq \pi^{-1 / 2} \delta^{-1}\|f\| \quad(z \in K, f \in H) $$  where $\|f\|=(f, f)^{1 / 2}$. Every Cauchy sequence in $H$ converges therefore uniformly on compact subsets of $D$. From this it follows easily that $H$ is complete. Hence $H$ is a Hilbert space.  Since $D$ is bounded, $M \in \mathscr{B}(H)$. Since $1 / z$ is bounded in $D$, $M^{-1} \in \mathscr{B}(H)$.  Assume now, to reach a contradiction, that $M=Q^{2}$ for some $Q \in \mathscr{B}(H)$. Fix $\alpha \in \Omega$. Put $\lambda=\alpha^{2}$. Then $\lambda \in D$. Define  $$ M_{\lambda}=M-\lambda I, \quad S=Q-\alpha I, \quad T=Q+\alpha I $$  so that  $$ S T=M_{\lambda}=T S $$  Since we are dealing with holomorphic functions, the formula  $$ \left(M_{\lambda} g\right)(z)=(z-\lambda) g(z) \quad(z \in D, g \in H) $$  shows that $M_{\lambda}$ is one-to-one and that its range $\mathscr{R}\left(M_{\lambda}\right)$ consists of exactly those $f \in H$ that satisfy $f(\lambda)=0$. Hence (6) shows that $\mathscr{R}\left(M_{\lambda}\right)$ is a closed subspace of $H$, of codimension 1 .  Since $M_{\lambda}$ is one-to-one, the first equation (8) shows that $T$ is one-to-one; the second shows that $S$ is one-to-one. Since $\mathscr{R}\left(M_{\lambda}\right) \neq H$, $M_{\lambda}$ is not invertible in $\mathscr{B}(H)$. Hence at least one of $S$ and $T$ is not invertible. Suppose $S$ is not invertible. Since $M_{\lambda}=S T, \mathscr{R}\left(M_{\lambda}\right) \subset \mathscr{R}(S)$, so that $\mathscr{R}(S)$ is either $\mathscr{R}\left(M_{\lambda}\right)$ or $H$. In the latter case, the open mapping theorem would imply that $S$ is invertible. Hence $S$ is a one-to-one mapping of $H$ onto $\mathscr{R}\left(M_{\lambda}\right)$. But the equation $M_{\lambda}=S T$ shows that $S$ maps $\mathscr{R}(T)$ onto $\mathscr{R}\left(M_{\lambda}\right)$. Hence $\mathscr{R}(T)=H$, and another application of the open mapping theorem shows that $T^{-1} \in \mathscr{B}(H)$.  We have now proved that one and only one of the operators $S$ and $T$ is invertible in $\mathscr{B}(H)$. Therefore exactly one of the numbers $\alpha$ and $-\alpha$ lies in $\sigma(Q)$, if $\alpha \in \Omega$. It follows that $\Omega$ is the union of two disjoint congruent sets, $\sigma(Q) \cap \Omega$ and $-\sigma(Q) \cap \Omega$, both of which are closed (relative to $\Omega$ ) since $\sigma(Q)$ is compact. The assumption that $M=Q^{2}$ leads thus to the conclusion that $\Omega$ is not connected, which contradicts the hypothesis.  This completes the proof.  The simplest example of a region $D$ that satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 12.38 is a circular annulus with center at 0 . In that case, a more conceptual proof can be given.

Fix a positive functional $F$ on $A$ that satisfies  $$ F(e)=1 \quad \text { and } \quad F\left(u^{*} u\right)=\|u\|^{2} $$  Such an $F$ exists, by Theorem 12.39. Define  $$ Y=\{y \in A: F(x y)=0 \text { for every } x \in A\} . $$  Since $F$ is continuous (Theorem 11.31), $Y$ is a closed subspace of $A$. Denote cosets of $Y$, that is, elements of $A / Y$, by $x^{\prime}$ :  $$ x^{\prime}=x+Y \quad(x \in A) . $$  We claim that  $$ \left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right)=F\left(b^{*} a\right) $$  defines an inner product on $A / Y$.  To see that $\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right)$ is well defined by (6), i.e., that it is independent of the choice of representatives $a$ and $b$, it is enough to show that $F\left(b^{*} a\right)=0$ if at least one of $a$ or $b$ lies in $Y$. If $a \in Y, F\left(b^{*} a\right)=0$ follows from (4). If $b \in Y$, then  $$ F\left(b^{*} a\right)=F\left(a^{*} b\right)=0, $$  by $(a)$ of Theorem 11.31 and another application of (4). Thus $\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right)$ is well defined, it is linear in $a^{\prime}$, and conjugate-linear in $b^{\prime}$, and  $$ \left(a^{\prime}, a^{\prime}\right)=F\left(a^{*} a\right) \geq 0, $$  since $F$ is a positive functional. If $\left(a^{\prime}, a^{\prime}\right)=0$, then $F\left(a^{*} a\right)=0$; hence $F(x a)=0$ for every $x \in A$, by $(b)$ of Theorem 11.31 , so that $a \in Y$ and $a^{\prime}=0$.  $A / Y$ is thus an inner product space, with norm $\left\|a^{\prime}\right\|=F\left(a^{*} a\right)^{1 / 2}$. Its completion $H$ is the Hilbert space that we are looking for. We define linear operators $T(x)$ on $A / Y$ by  $$ T(x) a^{\prime}=(x a)^{\prime} . $$  Again, one checks easily that this definition is independent of the choice of $a \in a^{\prime}$, for if $y \in Y$, (4) implies that $x y \in Y$. ( $Y$ is a left ideal in $A$.) It is obvious that $x \rightarrow T(x)$ is linear and that  $$ T\left(x_{1}\right) T\left(x_{2}\right)=T\left(x_{1} x_{2}\right) \quad\left(x_{1} \in A, x_{2} \in A\right) $$  in particular, (9) shows that $T(e)$ is the identity operator on $A / Y$. We now claim that  $$ \|T(x)\| \leq\|x\| \quad(x \in A) . $$  Once this is shown, the uniform continuity of the operators $T(x)$ enables us to extend them to bounded linear operators on $H$. Note that  $$ \left\|T(x) a^{\prime}\right\|^{2}=\left((x a)^{\prime},(x a)^{\prime}\right)=F\left(a^{*} x^{*} x a\right) $$  For fixed $a \in A$, define $G(x)=F\left(a^{*} x a\right)$. Then $G$ is a positive functional on $A$, so that  $$ G\left(x^{*} x\right) \leq G(e)\|x\|^{2} $$  by $(d)$ of Theorem 11.31. Thus  $$ \left\|T(x) a^{\prime}\right\|^{2}=G\left(x^{*} x\right) \leq F\left(a^{*} a\right)\|x\|^{2}=\left\|a^{\prime}\right\|^{2}\|x\|^{2} $$  which proves (11).  Next, the computation  $$ \begin{aligned} \left(T\left(x^{*}\right) a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right) & =\left(\left(x^{*} a\right)^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right)=F\left(b^{*} x^{*} a\right)=F\left((x b)^{*} a\right) \\ & =\left(a^{\prime},(x b)^{\prime}\right)=\left(a^{\prime}, T(x) b^{\prime}\right)=\left(T(x)^{*} a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right) \end{aligned} $$  shows that $T\left(x^{*}\right) a^{\prime}=T(x)^{*} a^{\prime}$, for all $a^{\prime} \in A / Y$. Since $A / Y$ is dense in $H$, this proves (1).  Finally, (3) and (12) show that  $$ \|u\|^{2}=F\left(u^{*} u\right)=\left\|T(u) e^{\prime}\right\|^{2} \leq\|T(u)\|^{2} $$  since $\left\|e^{\prime}\right\|^{2}=F\left(e^{*} e\right)=F(e)=1$.

Then, by definition, $v \in H$ if and only if  $$ \sum_{u}\left\|\pi_{u}(v)\right\|^{2}<\infty $$  where $\left\|\pi_{u}(v)\right\|$ denotes the $H_{u}$-norm of $\pi_{u}(v)$. The convergence of (1) implies that at most countably many $\pi_{u}(v)$ are different from 0 . The inner product in $H$ is given by  $$ \left(v^{ \prime}, v^{ \prime \n\prime}\right)=\sum_{u}\left(\pi_{u}\left(v^{ \prime}\right), \pi_{u}\left(v^{ \prime \n\prime}\right)\right) \quad\left(v^{ \prime}, v^{ \prime \n\prime} \in H\right) $$  so that $\|v\|^{2}=(v, v)$ is the left side of (1).

$$
T=i(I+U)(I-U)^{-1}
$$

(The Cayley transforms of distinct symmetric operators are therefore distinct.)

(c) $U$ is unitary if and only if $T$ is self-adjoint.

Conversely, if $V$ is an operator in $H$ which is an isometry, and if $I-V$ is one-to-one, then $V$ is the Cayley transform of a symmetric operator in $\mathrm{H}$.","By Theorem 13.16, $T$ is closed if and only if $\mathscr{R}(T+i I)$ is closed. By Lemma $13.18, U$ is closed if and only if $\mathscr{D}(U)$ is closed. Since $\mathscr{D}(U)=\mathscr{R}(T+i I)$, by the definition of the Cayley transform, $(a)$ is proved.  The one-to-one correspondence $x \leftrightarrow z$ between $\mathscr{D}(T)$ and $\mathscr{D}(U)=\mathscr{R}(T+i I)$, given by  $$ z=T x+i x, \quad U z=T x-i x $$  can be rewritten in the form  $$ (I-U) z=2 i x, \quad(I+U) z=2 T x $$  This shows that $I-U$ is one-to-one, that $\mathscr{R}(I-U)=\mathscr{D}(T)$, so that $(I-U)^{-1}$ maps $\mathscr{D}(T)$ onto $\mathscr{D}(U)$, and that  $$ 2 T x=(I+U) z=(I+U)(I-U)^{-1}(2 i x) \quad[x \in \mathscr{D}(T)] $$  This proves $(b)$.  Assume now that $T$ is self-adjoint. Then  $$ \mathscr{R}\left(I+T^{2}\right)=H $$  by Theorem 13.13. Since  $$ (T+i I)(T-i I)=I+T^{2}=(T-i I)(T+i I) $$  [the three operators (5) have domain $\left.\mathscr{D}\left(T^{2}\right)\right]$, it follows from (4) that  $$ \mathscr{D}(U)=\mathscr{R}(T+i I)=H $$  and  $$ \mathscr{R}(U)=\mathscr{R}(T-i I)=H \text {. } $$  Since $U$ is an isometry, (6) and (7) imply that $U$ is unitary (Theorem 12.13).  To complete the proof of $(c)$, assume that $U$ is unitary. Then  $$ [\mathscr{R}(I-U)]^{\perp}=\mathscr{N}(I-U)=\{0\} $$  by $(b)$ and the normality of $I-U$ (Theorem 12.12$)$, so that $\mathscr{D}(T)=$ $\mathscr{R}(I-U)$ dense in $H$. Thus $T^{*}$ is defined, and $T \subset T^{*}$.  Fix $y \in \mathscr{D}\left(T^{*}\right)$. Since $\mathscr{R}(T+i I)=\mathscr{D}(U)=H$, there exists $y_{0} \in$ $\mathscr{D}(T)$ such that  $$ \left(T^{*}+i I\right) y=(T+i I) y_{0}=\left(T^{*}+i I\right) y_{0} \text {. } $$  The last equality holds because $T \subset T^{*}$. If $y_{1}=y-y_{0}$, then $y_{1} \in$ $\mathscr{D}\left(T^{*}\right)$ and, for every $x \in \mathscr{D}(T)$,  $$ \left((T-i I) x, y_{1}\right)=\left(x,\left(T^{*}+i I\right) y_{1}\right)=(x, 0)=0 $$  Thus $y_{1} \perp \mathscr{R}(T-i I)=\mathscr{R}(U)=H$, and so $y_{1}=0$, and $y=y_{0} \in \mathscr{D}(T)$.  Hence $T^{*} \subset T$, and $(c)$ is proved.  Finally, let $V$ be as in the statement of the converse. Then there is a one-to-one correspondence $z \leftrightarrow x$ between $\mathscr{D}(V)$ and $\mathscr{R}(I-V)$, given by  $$ x=z-V z $$  Define $S$ on $\mathscr{D}(S)=\mathscr{R}(I-V)$ by  $$ S x=i(z+V z) \quad \text { if } x=z-V z $$  If $x \in \mathscr{D}(S)$ and $y \in \mathscr{D}(S)$, then $x=z-V z$ and $y=u-V u$ for some $z \in \mathscr{D}(V)$ and $u \in \mathscr{D}(V)$. Since $V$ is an isometry, it now follows from (a) of Lemma 13.18 that  $$ \begin{aligned} (S x, y) & =i(z+V z, u-V u)=i(V z, u)-i(z, V u) \\ & =(z-V z, i u+i V u)=(x, S y) . \end{aligned} $$  Hence $S$ is symmetric. Since (12) can be written in the form  $$ 2 i V z=S x-i x, \quad 2 i z=S x+i x \quad[z \in \mathscr{D}(V)] $$  we see that  $$ V(S x+i x)=S x-i x \quad[x \in \mathscr{D}(S)] $$  and that $\mathscr{D}(V)=\mathscr{R}(S+i I)$. Therefore $V$ is the Cayley transform of $S$.","If $T$ is a symmetric operator in $H$ (not necessarily densely defined): $\|T x+i x\|^{2}=\|x\|^{2}+\|T x\|^{2} \quad[x \in \mathscr{D}(T)]$;If $T$ is a symmetric operator in $H$ (not necessarily densely defined): $T$ is a closed operator if and only if $\mathscr{R}(T+i I)$ is closed;If $T$ is a symmetric operator in $H$ (not necessarily densely defined): $T+i$ is one-to-one;If $T$ is a symmetric operator in $H$ (not necessarily densely defined) and $\mathscr{R}(T+i I)=H$: then $T$ is maximally symmetric;If $T$ is a symmetric operator in $H$ (not necessarily densely defined): The preceding statements are also true if $i$ is replaced by $-i$; Suppose $T$ is a densely defined closed operator in $H$, and $Q=I+T^{*} T$.

Scalar multiplication is even easier. Thus $\mathscr{D}_{f}$ is a subspace of $H$.  For $n=1,2,3, \ldots$, let $\omega_{n}$ be the subset of $\Omega$ in which $|f|<n$.

Hence $\mathscr{D}_{f}$ is dense.  If $x \in H, y \in H$, and $f$ is a bounded measurable function on $\Omega$, the Radon-Nikodym theorem [23] shows that there is a measurable function $u$ on $\Omega$, with $|u|=1$, such that  $$ \text { uf } d E_{x, y}=|f| d\left|E_{x, y}\right| \text {. } $$  Hence  $$ \int_{\Omega}|f| d\left|E_{x, y}\right|=(\Psi(u f) x, y) \leq\|\Psi(u f) x\|\|y\| $$  By Theorem 12.21,  $$ \|\Psi(u f) x\|^{2}=\int_{\Omega}|u f|^{2} d E_{x, x}=\int_{\Omega}|f|^{2} d E_{x, x} $$  Now (9) and (10) give (2) for bounded $f$.

Then $g=1 / f \in L^{\infty}(E), f g=1$, hence $\Psi(f) \Psi(g)=\Psi(1)=I$, which proves that $\mathscr{R}(\Psi(f))=H$. Since $|f|>0$, $\Psi(f)$ is one-to-one, as in the proof of $(b)$.

Now define, for fixed $x \in X$,  $$ \varphi(s)=\left\{\exp \left((t-s) A_{\varepsilon}\right)\right\} Q(s) x \quad(0 \leq s \leq t) $$  If $x \in \mathscr{D}(A)$, it follows from $(d)$ that  $$ \varphi^{\prime}(s)=\left\{\exp \left((t-s) A_{\varepsilon}\right)\right\} Q(s)\left(A x-A_{\varepsilon} x\right) $$  Thus (a) and (9) show that there is a $K(t)<\infty$ such that  $$ \left\|\varphi^{\prime}(s)\right\| \leq K(t)\left\|A x-A_{\varepsilon} x\right\| $$  whenever $0 \leq s \leq t, 0<\varepsilon \leq 1$, and $x \in \mathscr{D}(A)$.  Since $\varphi(t)=Q(t) x$ and $\varphi(0)=\left\{\exp \left(t A_{\varepsilon}\right)\right\} x,(12)$ implies  $$ \left\|Q(t) x-\left\{\exp \left(t A_{\varepsilon}\right)\right\} x\right\| \leq t K(t)\left\|A x-A_{\varepsilon} x\right\| $$  for $x \in \mathscr{D}(A), 0<\varepsilon \leq 1$. This gives $(e)$ for $x \in \mathscr{D}(A)$.  However, $\left\|Q(t)-\exp \left(t A_{\varepsilon}\right)\right\|$ is bounded on $0 \leq t \leq T, 0<\varepsilon \leq 1$, by $(a)$ and (9). These operators form therefore an equicontinuous family (Chapter 4, Exercise 3); it follows that their convergence on the dense set $\mathscr{D}(A)$ forces their convergence on all of $X$ (Chapter 2, Exercise 14). This proves $(e)$.",

Thus $R(\lambda) \in \mathscr{B}(X)$. The definition of $R(\lambda)$ shows that  $$ \varepsilon A_{\varepsilon} R(\lambda) x=\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\lambda t} Q(t+\varepsilon) x d t-\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\lambda t} Q(t) x d t $$  If we replace $t$ by $t-\varepsilon$ in the first integral, we are led to  $$ A_{\varepsilon} R(\lambda) x=\frac{e^{\lambda \varepsilon-1}}{\varepsilon} R(\lambda) x-\frac{1}{\varepsilon} e^{\lambda \varepsilon} \int_{0}^{\varepsilon} e^{-\lambda t} Q(t) x d t $$  As $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$, the right side of (15) converges to $\lambda R(\lambda) x-x$. This shows that $R(\lambda) x \in \mathscr{D}(A)$ and that  $$ (\lambda I-A) R(\lambda) x=x \quad(x \in X) $$  On the other hand, if $x \in \mathscr{D}(A)$, we can apply $(d)$ to  $$ R(\lambda) A_{\varepsilon} x=\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\lambda t} Q(t) A_{\varepsilon} x d t $$  and see that  $$ R(\lambda) A x=\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\lambda t} \frac{d}{d t} Q(t) x d t=-x+\lambda R(\lambda) x $$  by an integration by parts. Thus  $$ R(\lambda)(\lambda I-A) x=x \quad(x \in \mathscr{D}(A)) $$  In particular, $\mathscr{D}(A)$ lies in the range of $R(\lambda)$. This completes the proof.",

If $(a)$ holds, the Banach-Steinhaus theorem implies that the norms of the operators $A_{\varepsilon}$ are bounded, for all sufficiently small $\varepsilon>0$. Since $Q(\varepsilon)-I=\varepsilon A_{\varepsilon},(b)$ follows from $(a)$.  If (b) holds, then also $\left\|M_{t}-I\right\| \rightarrow 0$ as $t \rightarrow 0$. Fix $t>0$, so small that $M_{t}$ is invertible in $\mathscr{B}(X)$. Since $M_{t} A_{\varepsilon}=A_{t} M_{\varepsilon}$, we have  $$ A_{\varepsilon}=\left(M_{t}\right)^{-1} A_{t} M_{\varepsilon} $$  As $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$, (1) shows first of all that $A_{\varepsilon} x$ converges, for every $x \in X$ [since $M_{\varepsilon} x \rightarrow x$ and $\left(M_{t}\right)^{-1} A_{t} \in \mathscr{B}(X)$ ], second that $A=\left(M_{t}\right)^{-1} A_{t}$, and third that  $$ \left\|A_{\varepsilon}-A\right\| \leq\left\|\left(M_{t}\right)^{-1} A_{t}\right\|\left\|M_{\varepsilon}-I\right\| \rightarrow 0 \quad \text { as } \varepsilon \rightarrow 0 $$  The formula $Q(t)=\exp (t A)$ follows now from $(e)$ of Theorem 13.35, since (2) implies that  $$ \lim _{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0}\left\|\exp \left(t A_{\varepsilon}\right)-\exp (t A)\right\|=0 \quad(0 \leq t<\infty) $$  Thus $(c)$ follows from $(b)$.

for all $\lambda>\gamma$ and all positive integers $m$.","If $A$ is related to $\{Q(t)\}$ as in Theorem 13.35, we saw there that $(\lambda I-A)^{-1}=R(\lambda)$, for $\lambda>\gamma$, where  $$ R(\lambda) x=\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\lambda t} Q(t) x d t $$  is the Laplace transform of $Q(t) x$. Hence $R(\lambda)^{2} x$ is the transform of the convolution  $$ \int_{0}^{t} Q(t-s) Q(s) x d s=t Q(t) x $$  (The formalism is the same as for Fourier transforms.) Continuing in this way, we find that  $$ R(\lambda)^{m} x=\frac{1}{(m-1) !} \int_{0}^{\infty} t^{m-1} e^{-\lambda t} Q(t) x d t $$  for $m=1,2,3, \ldots$ Therefore, with $C$ and $\gamma$ as in $(a)$ of Theorem 13.35,  $$ \left\|R(\lambda)^{m}\right\| \leq \frac{C}{(m-1) !} \int_{0}^{\infty} t^{m-1} e^{-(\lambda-\gamma) t} d t=C(\lambda-\gamma)^{-m} $$  This proves the necessity of (1).  For the converse, set $S(\varepsilon)=(I-\varepsilon A)^{-1}$, so that (1) becomes  $$ \left\|S(\varepsilon)^{m}\right\| \leq C(1-\varepsilon \gamma)^{-m} \quad\left(0<\varepsilon<\varepsilon_{0}, m=1,2,3, \ldots\right) $$  and the relations  $$ (I-\varepsilon A) S(\varepsilon) x=x=S(\varepsilon)(I-\varepsilon A) x $$  hold, the first for all $x \in X$, the second for all $x \in \mathscr{D}(A)$.  If $x \in \mathscr{D}(A)$, then $x-S(\varepsilon) x=-\varepsilon S(\varepsilon) x$, so that  $$ \lim S(\varepsilon) x=x $$  But since $\|S(\varepsilon)\| \leq C\left(1-\varepsilon_{0} \gamma\right)^{-1},\left\{S(\varepsilon): 0<\varepsilon<\varepsilon_{0}\right\}$ is equicontinuous, and hence (8) holds for all $x \in X$.  Next we set  $$ T(t, \varepsilon)=\exp (t A S(\varepsilon)) $$  and claim that  $$ \|T(t, \varepsilon)\| \leq C \exp \left\{\frac{\gamma t}{1-\varepsilon \gamma}\right\} \quad\left(0<\varepsilon<\varepsilon_{0}, t>0\right) $$  Indeed, the relation $\varepsilon A S(\varepsilon)=S(\varepsilon)-I[$ see (7)] shows that  $$ T(t, \varepsilon)=e^{-t / \varepsilon} \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{t^{m}}{m ! \varepsilon^{m}} S(\varepsilon)^{m} $$  Now (10) follows from (6) and (11).  For $x \in \mathscr{D}(A)$, (7) and (9) show that  $$ \frac{d}{d t}\left\{T(t, \varepsilon) T(t, \delta)^{-1} x\right\}=T(t, \varepsilon) T(t, \delta)^{-1}(S(\varepsilon)-S(\delta)) A x $$  If we integrate this and apply $T(t, \delta)$ to the result, we obtain  $$ T(t, \varepsilon) x-T(t, \delta) x=\int_{0}^{t} T(u, \varepsilon) T(t-u, \delta)(S(\varepsilon)-S(\delta)) A x d u $$  If we use (8) with $A x$ in place of $x$, and refer to (10), we see that the right side of (12) converges to 0 when $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$ and $\delta \rightarrow 0$. The limit  $$ Q(t) x=\lim _{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0} T(t, \varepsilon) x $$  exists therefore for every $x \in \mathscr{D}(A)$, uniformly on every bounded subset of $[0, \infty)$. Moreover, (10) shows that $\|Q(t)\| \leq C e^{\gamma t}$. By equicontinuity, and the assumption that $\mathscr{D}(A)$ is dense, we see now that (13) holds for all $x \in X$. Since $T(t, \varepsilon)$ is defined by (9), it follows that $\{Q(t)\}$ is a semigroup, as in Definition 13.34.  Let $\tilde{A}$ be the infinitesimal generator of $\{Q(t)\}$. Then, by $(f)$ of Theorem 13.35,  $$ (\lambda I-\tilde{A})^{-1} x=\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\lambda t} Q(t) x d t \quad(\lambda>\gamma) $$  On the other hand, $A S(\varepsilon)$ is the infinitesimal generator of $\{\exp (t A S(\varepsilon))\}=\{T(t, \varepsilon)\}$. Thus  $$ (\lambda I-A S(\varepsilon))^{-1} x=\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\lambda t} T(t, \varepsilon) x d t $$  By (13) this becomes  $$ (\lambda I-A)^{-1} x=\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\lambda t} Q(t) x d t $$  Comparison of (14) and (16) shows now that $\lambda I-A$ and $\lambda I-\tilde{A}$ have the same inverse for all sufficiently large $\lambda$, and this implies that $\tilde{A}=A$.","If the semigroup $\{Q(t)\}$ satisfies the preceding hypotheses, then there are constants $C, \gamma$ such that

Motivated by the fact that every continuous complex function that satisfies $f(s+t)=f(s) f(t)$ has the form $f(t)=\exp (A t)$, and that $f$ is determined by the number $A=f^{\prime}(0)$, we associate with $\{Q(t)\}$ the operators $A_{\varepsilon}$, by

This representation of unitary semigroups is a classical theorem of M. H. Stone.","Since each $Q(s)$ commutes with each $Q(t)$. Theorem 12.16 implies that $Q(s)$ and $Q(t)^{*}$ commute. The smallest closed subalgebra of $\mathscr{B}(H)$ that contains all $Q(t)$ and all $Q(t)^{*}$ is therefore normal. Let $\Delta$ be its maximal ideal space, and let $E$ be the corresponding resolution of the identity, as in Theorem 12.22.  Let $f_{t}$ and $a_{\varepsilon}$ be the Gelfand transforms of $Q(t)$ and $A_{\varepsilon}$, respectively. Then  $$ a_{\varepsilon}=\frac{f_{\varepsilon}-1}{\varepsilon} \quad(\varepsilon>0) $$  and a simple computation gives  $$ a_{2 \varepsilon}-a_{\varepsilon}=\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\left(a_{\varepsilon}\right)^{2} $$  since $f_{2 \varepsilon}=\left(f_{\varepsilon}\right)^{2}$. Define  $$ b(p)=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{2-n}(p) $$  for those $p \in \Delta$ at which this limit exists (as a complex number), and define $b(p)=0$ at all other $p \in \Delta$. Then $b$ is a complex Borel function on $\Delta$. Put $B=\Psi(b)$, as in Theorem 13.24, with domain  $$ \mathscr{D}(B)=\left\{x \in H: \int_{\Delta}|b|^{2} d E_{x, x}<\infty\right\} $$  Then $B$ is a normal operator in $H$.  We will show that $A=B$.  If $x \in \mathscr{D}(A)$ then $\left\|A_{\varepsilon} x\right\|$ is bounded, as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. Hence there exists $C_{x}<\infty$ such that  $$ \int_{\Delta}\left|a_{\varepsilon}\right|^{2} d E_{x, x}=\left\|A_{\varepsilon} x\right\|^{2} \leq C_{x} \quad(0<\varepsilon \leq 1) $$  and therefore  $$ \int_{\Delta}\left|a_{2 \varepsilon}-a_{\varepsilon}\right| d E_{x, x} \leq \frac{\varepsilon}{2} C_{x} \quad(0<\delta \leq 1) $$  by (7). Take $\varepsilon=2^{-n}(n=1,2,3, \ldots)$ in (11) and add the resulting inequalities. It follows that  $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{2-n+1}-a_{2-n}\right|<\infty \quad \text { a.e. }\left[E_{x, x}\right] $$  The limit (8) exists therefore a.e. $\left[E_{x, x}\right]$, and now Fatou's lemma and (10) imply that  $$ \int_{\Delta}|b|^{2} d E_{x, x} \leq C_{x} $$  Consequently, $\mathscr{D}(A) \subset \mathscr{D}(B)$.  Part $(a)$ of Theorem 13.35 shows that $\left\|\exp \left(A_{\varepsilon}\right)\right\| \leq \gamma_{1}<\infty$ for $0<\varepsilon \leq 1$, where $\gamma_{1}$ depends on $\{Q(t)\}$. Hence $\left|\exp a_{\varepsilon}(p)\right| \leq \gamma_{1}$ for every $p \in \Delta$, since the Gelfand transform is an isometry on $B^{*}$ algebras. It now follows from (8) that $|\exp b(p)| \leq \gamma_{1}$ for every $p \in \Delta$. Hence there exists $\gamma<\infty$ such that  $$ \operatorname{Re} b(p) \leq \gamma \quad(p \in \Delta) $$  For every $x \in \mathscr{D}(A)$ and every $t \geq 0$,  $$ \left\|\exp \left(t A_{\varepsilon}\right) x-\exp (t B) x\right\|^{2}=\int_{\Delta}\left|\exp \left(t a_{\varepsilon}\right)-\exp (t b)\right|^{2} d E_{x, x} $$  tends to 0 as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$ through the sequence $\left\{2^{-n}\right\}$, because the integrand is bounded by $4 \gamma_{1}^{2 t}$ and its limit is 0 a.e. $\left[E_{x, x}\right]$. Hence $(e)$ of Theorem 13.35 implies that  $$ Q(t) x=e^{t B} x \quad[x \in \mathscr{D}(A)] $$  However, $e^{t b}$ is a bounded function on $\Delta, e^{t B} \in \mathscr{B}(H)$, and since (16) shows that the continuous operators $Q(t)$ and $e^{t B}$ coincide on the dense set $\mathscr{D}(A)$, we conclude that  $$ Q(t)=e^{t B} \quad(0 \leq t<\infty) $$  It follows from (17) that  $$ A_{\varepsilon} x-B x=\left(\frac{e^{\varepsilon B}-I}{\varepsilon}-B\right) x $$  so that  $$ \left\|A_{\varepsilon} x-B x\right\|^{2}=\int_{\Delta}\left|\frac{e^{\varepsilon b}-1}{\varepsilon}-b\right|^{2} d E_{x, x} $$  As $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$, the integrand (19) tends to 0 , at every point of $\Delta$. Since $\left|\left(e^{z}-1\right) / z\right|$ is bounded on every half-plane $\{z: \operatorname{Re} z \leq c\}$, and since the integrand (19) can be written in the form  $$ \left|\frac{e^{\varepsilon b}-1}{\varepsilon b}-1\right|^{2}|b|^{2} $$  it follows from (14) and the dominated convergence theorem that  $$ \lim _{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0}\left\|A_{\varepsilon} x-B x\right\|^{2}=0 \quad \text { if } x \in \mathscr{D}(B) $$  This proves that $\mathscr{D}(B) \subset \mathscr{D}(A)$ and that $A=B$.  That the real part of $\sigma(A)$ is bounded above follows now from $(14)$ and $(c)$ of Theorem 13.27.  This completes the proof, except for the final statement about unitary semigroups. If each $Q(t)$ is unitary, then $\left|f_{\varepsilon}\right|=1$, (6) shows that $\lim a_{\varepsilon}$ is pure imaginary at every point at which it exists, as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$, hence $b(p)$ is pure imaginary at every $p \in \Delta$, and if $S=-i B$ then (17) gives (3), and (c) of Theorem 13.24 shows that $S$ is self-adjoint.","(Fuglede-Putnam-Rosenblum) Assume that $M, N$, $T \in \mathscr{B}(H), M$ and $N$ are normal, and

The converse is the nontrivial part of the theorem.  Suppose $E \subset X$ is weakly bounded and $U$ is an original neighborhood of 0 in $X$.  Since $X$ is locally convex, there is a convex, balanced, original neighborhood $V$ of 0 in $X$ such that $\bar{V} \subset U$.

Suppose $x_{0} \in X$ but $x_{0} \notin \bar{V}$. Theorem 3.7 (with $\bar{V}$ in place of $B$ ) then shows that $\Lambda x_{0}>1$ for some $\Lambda \in K$. This proves (2).  Since $E$ is weakly bounded, there corresponds to each $\Lambda \in X^{*}$ a number $\gamma(\Lambda)<\infty$ such that  $$ |\Lambda x| \leq \gamma(\Lambda) \quad(x \in E) $$  Since $K$ is convex and weak*-compact (Theorem 3.15) and since the functions $\Lambda \rightarrow \Lambda x$ are weak*-continuous, we can apply Theorem 2.9 (with $X^{*}$ in place of $X$ and the scalar field in place of $Y$ ) to conclude from (3) that there is a constant $\gamma<\infty$ such that  $$ |\Lambda x| \leq \gamma \quad(x \in E, \Lambda \in K) $$  Now (2) and (4) show that $\gamma^{-1} x \in \bar{V} \subset U$ for all $x \in E.

Since  $$ f(x)+f(y)=f(x+y) \leq p(x+y) \leq p\left(x-x_{1}\right)+p\left(x_{1}+y\right) $$  we have  $$ f(x)-p\left(x-x_{1}\right) \leq p\left(y+x_{1}\right)-f(y) \quad(x, y \in M) $$  Let $\alpha$ be the least upper bound of the left side of (1), as $x$ ranges over $M$.

In combination with (4), this proves that $f_{1} \leq p$ on $M_{1}$.  The second part of the proof can be done by whatever one's favorite method of transfinite induction is; one can use well-ordering, or Zorn's lemma, or Hausdorff's maximality theorem.  Let $\mathscr{P}$ be the collection of all ordered pairs $\left(M^{\prime}, f^{\prime}\right)$, where $M^{\prime}$ is a subspace of $X$ that contains $M$ and $f^{\prime}$ is a linear functional on $M^{\prime}$ that extends $f$ and satisfies $f^{\prime} \leq p$ on $M^{\prime}$. Partially order $\mathscr{P}$ by declaring $\left(M^{\prime}, f^{\prime}\right) \leq\left(M^{\prime \prime}, f^{\prime \prime}\right)$ to mean that $M^{\prime} \subset M^{\prime \prime}$ and $f^{\prime \prime}=f^{\prime}$ on $M^{\prime}$. By Hausdorff's maximality theorem there exists a maximal totally ordered subcollection $\Omega$ of $\mathscr{P}$.  Let $\Phi$ be the collection of all $M^{\prime}$ such that $\left(M^{\prime}, f^{\prime}\right) \in \Omega$. Then $\Phi$ is totally ordered by set inclusion, and the union $\tilde{M}$ of all members of $\Phi$ is therefore a subspace of $X$. If $x \in \tilde{M}$ then $x \in M^{\prime}$ for some $M^{\prime} \in \Phi$; define $\Lambda x=f^{\prime}(x)$, where $f^{\prime}$ is the function which occurs in the pair $\left(M^{\prime}, f^{\prime}\right) \in \Omega$.  It is now easy to check that $\Lambda$ is well defined on $\tilde{M}$, that $\Lambda$ is linear, and that $\Lambda \leq p$. If $\tilde{M}$ were a proper subspace of $X$, the first part of the proof would give a further extension of $\Lambda$, and this would contradict the maximality of $\Omega$. Thus $\tilde{M}=X$.  Finally, the inequality $\Lambda \leq p$ implies that  $$ -p(-x) \leq-\Lambda(-x)=\Lambda x $$  for all $x \in X$. This completes the proof.",

(b) If $S \in \mathscr{P}, \Lambda \in X^{*}, \mu$ is the maximum of $\operatorname{Re} \Lambda$ on $S$, and  $$ S_{\Lambda}=\{x \in S: \operatorname{Re} \Lambda x=\mu\} $$  then $S_{\Lambda} \in \mathscr{P}$.  The proof of $(a)$ is immediate. To prove $(b)$, suppose $t x+$ $(1-t) y=z \in S_{\Lambda}, x \in K, y \in K, 0<t<1$. Since $z \in S$ and $S \in \mathscr{P}$, we have $x \in S$ and $y \in S$.

Since $\operatorname{Re} \Lambda z=\mu$ and $\Lambda$ is linear, we conclude: $\operatorname{Re} \Lambda x=\mu=\operatorname{Re} \Lambda y$. Hence $x \in S_{\Lambda}$ and $y \in S_{\Lambda}$. This proves $(b)$.  Choose some $S \in \mathscr{P}$. Let $\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$ be the collection of all members of $\mathscr{P}$ that are subsets of $S$. Since $S \in \mathscr{P}^{\prime}, \mathscr{P}^{\prime}$ is not empty. Partially order $\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$ by set inclusion, let $\Omega$ be a maximal totally ordered subcollection of $\mathscr{P}^{\prime}$, and let $M$ be the intersection of all members of $\Omega$. Since $\Omega$ is a collection of compact sets with the finite intersection property, $M \neq \varnothing$. By $(a), M \in \mathscr{P}^{\prime}$. The maximality of $\Omega$ implies that no proper subset of $M$ belongs to $\mathscr{P}$. It now follows from $(b)$ that every $\Lambda \in X^{*}$ is constant on $M$.

","Regard $X$ again as a real vector space. Let $C(Q)$ be the Banach space of all real continuous functions on $Q$, with the supremum norm. The Riesz representation theorem identifies the dual space $C(Q)^{*}$ with the space of all real Borel measures on $Q$ that are differences of regular positive ones. With this identification in mind, we define a mapping  $$ \phi: C(Q)^{*} \rightarrow X $$  by  $$ \phi(\mu)=\int_{Q} x d \mu(x) $$  Let $P$ be the set of all regular Borel probability measures on $Q$. The theorem asserts that $\phi(P)=\bar{H}$.  For each $x \in Q$, the unit mass $\delta_{x}$ concentrated at $x$ belongs to $P$. Since $\phi\left(\delta_{x}\right)=x$, we see that $Q \subset \phi(P)$. Since $\phi$ is linear and $P$ is convex, it follows that $H \subset \phi(P)$, where $H$ is the convex hull of $Q$. By Theorem 3.27, $\phi(P) \subset \bar{H}$. Therefore all that remains to be done is to show that $\phi(P)$ is closed in $X$.  This is a consequence of the following two facts:  (i) $P$ is weak*-compact in $C(Q)^{*}$.  (ii) The mapping $\phi$ defined by (4) is continuous if $C(Q)^{*}$ is given its weak*-topology and if $X$ is given its weak topology.  Once we have (i) and (ii), it follows that $\phi(P)$ is weakly compact, hence weakly closed, and since weakly closed sets are strongly closed, we have the desired conclusion.  To prove $(i)$, note that  $$ P \subset\left\{\mu:\left|\int_{Q} h d \mu\right| \leq 1 \text { if }\|h\|<1\right\} $$  and that this larger set is weak*-compact, by the Banach-Alaoglu theorem. It is therefore enough to show that $P$ is weak*-closed.  If $h \in C(Q)$ and $h \geq 0$, put  (6)  $$ E_{h}=\left\{\mu: \int_{Q} h d \mu \geq 0\right\} $$  Since $\mu \rightarrow \int h d \mu$ is continuous, by the definition of the weak*topology, each $E_{h}$ is weak*-closed. So is the set  $$ E=\left\{\mu: \int_{Q} 1 d \mu=1\right\} $$  Since $P$ is the intersection of $E$ and the sets $E_{h}, P$ is weak*-closed.  To prove (ii) it is enough to prove that $\phi$ is continuous at the origin, since $\phi$ is linear. Every weak neighborhood of 0 in $X$ contains a set of the form  $$ W=\left\{y \in X:\left|\Lambda_{i} y\right|<r_{i} \quad \text { for } \quad 1 \leq i \leq n\right\} $$  where $\Lambda_{i} \in X^{*}$ and $r_{i}>0$. The restrictions of the $\Lambda_{i}$ to $Q$ lie in $C(Q)$. Hence  $$ V=\left\{\mu \in C(Q)^{*}:\left|\int_{Q} \Lambda_{i} d \mu\right|<r_{i} \quad \text { for } 1 \leq i \leq n\right\} $$  is a weak*-neighborhood of 0 in $C(Q)^{*}$. But  $$ \int_{Q} \Lambda_{i} d \mu=\Lambda_{i}\left(\int_{Q} x d \mu(x)\right)=\Lambda_{i} \phi(\mu) $$  by Definition 3.26. It follows from (8), (9), and (10) that $\phi(V) \subset W$.

$$
(\Lambda f)(q)=\Lambda(f(q)) \quad(q \in Q)

If there exists a vector $y \in X$ such that

$$
\Lambda y=\int_{Q}(\Lambda f) d \mu

for every $\Lambda \in X^{*}$, then we define

$$

It is clear that there is at most one such $y$, because $X^{*}$ separates points on $X$. Thus there is no uniqueness problem.

Existence will be proved only in the rather special case (sufficient for many applications) in which $Q$ is compact and $f$ is continuous. In that case, $f(Q)$ is compact, and the only other requirement that will be imposed is that the closed convex hull of $f(Q)$ should be compact. By Theorem 3.20, this additional requirement is automatically satisfied when $X$ is a Fréchet space.

(d) $T(X)=Y$.

Moreover, if (d) holds, then (a) holds for some $\delta>0$.","Assume $(a)$, and pick $y_{0} \notin \overline{T(U)}$. Since $\overline{T(U)}$ is convex, closed, and balanced, Theorem 3.7 shows that there is a $y^{*}$ such that $\left|\left\langle y, y^{*}\right\rangle\right| \leq 1$ for every $y \in \overline{T(U)}$, but $\left|\left\langle y_{0}, y^{*}\right\rangle\right|>1$. If $x \in U$, it follows that  $$ \left|\left\langle x, T^{*} y^{*}\right\rangle\right|=\left|\left\langle T x, y^{*}\right\rangle\right| \leq 1 $$  Thus $\left\|T^{*} y^{*}\right\| \leq 1$, and now (a) gives  $$ \delta<\delta\left|\left\langle y_{0}, y^{*}\right\rangle\right| \leq \delta\left\|y_{0}\right\|\left\|y^{*}\right\| \leq\left\|y_{0}\right\|\left\|T^{*} y^{*}\right\| \leq\left\|y_{0}\right\| \text {. } $$  It follows that $y \in \overline{T(U)}$ if $\|y\| \leq \delta$. Thus $(a) \rightarrow(b)$.  Next, assume $(b)$. Take $\delta=1$, without loss of generality. Then $\overline{T(U)} \supset \bar{V}$. To every $y \in Y$ and every $\varepsilon>0$ corresponds therefore an $x \in X$ with $\|x\| \leq\|y\|$ and $\|y-T x\|<\varepsilon$.  Pick $y_{1} \in V$. Pick $\varepsilon_{n}>0$ so that  $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \varepsilon_{n}<1-\left\|y_{1}\right\| $$  Assume $n \geq 1$ and $y_{n}$ is picked. There exists $x_{n}$ such that $\left\|x_{n}\right\| \leq\left\|y_{n}\right\|$ and $\left\|y_{n}-T x_{n}\right\|<\varepsilon_{n}$. Put  $$ y_{n+1}=y_{n}-T x_{n} \text {. } $$  By induction, this process defines two sequences $\left\{x_{n}\right\}$ and $\left\{y_{n}\right\}$. Note that  $$ \left\|x_{n+1}\right\| \leq\left\|y_{n+1}\right\|=\left\|y_{n}-T x_{n}\right\|<\varepsilon_{n} $$  Hence  $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left\|x_{n}\right\| \leq\left\|x_{1}\right\|+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \varepsilon_{n} \leq\left\|y_{1}\right\|+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \varepsilon_{n}<1 $$  It follows that $x=\sum x_{n}$ is in $U$ (see Exercise 23) and that  $$ T x=\lim _{N \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=1}^{N} T x_{n}=\lim _{N \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(y_{n}-y_{n+1}\right)=y_{1} $$  since $y_{N+1} \rightarrow 0$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$. Thus $y_{1}=T x \in T(U)$, which proves $(c)$.  Note that the preceding argument is just a specialized version of part of the proof of the open mapping theorem 2.11.  That $(c)$ implies $(d)$ is obvious.  Assume $(d)$. By the open mapping theorem, there is a $\delta>0$ such that $T(U) \supset \delta V$. Hence  $$ \begin{aligned} \left\|T^{*} y^{*}\right\| & =\sup \left\{\left|\left\langle x, T^{*} y^{*}\right\rangle\right|: x \in U\right\} \\ & =\sup \left\{\left|\left\langle T x, y^{*}\right\rangle\right|: x \in U\right\} \\ & \geq \sup \left\{\left|\left\langle y, y^{*}\right\rangle\right|: y \in \delta V\right\}=\delta\left\|y^{*}\right\| \end{aligned} $$  for every $y^{*} \in Y^{*}$.

4.14,"If $X$ and $Y$ are Banach spaces and if $T \in \mathscr{B}(X, Y)$, then each of the following three conditions implies the other two:

(a) $\mathscr{R}(T)$ is closed in $Y$.

(b) $\mathscr{R}\left(T^{*}\right)$ is weak*-closed in $X^{*}$.

(c) $\mathscr{R}\left(T^{*}\right)$ is norm-closed in $X^{*}$.

","It is obvious that $(b)$ implies $(c)$. We will prove that $(a)$ implies $(b)$ and that $(c)$ implies $(a)$.  Suppose $(a)$ holds. By Theorem 4.12 and $(b)$ of Theorem 4.7, $\mathscr{N}(T)^{\perp}$ is the weak*-closure of $\mathscr{R}\left(T^{*}\right)$. To prove $(b)$ it is therefore enough to show that $\mathscr{N}(T)^{\perp} \subset \mathscr{R}\left(T^{*}\right)$.  Pick $x^{*} \in \mathscr{N}(T)^{\perp}$. Define a linear functional $\Lambda$ on $\mathscr{R}(T)$ by  $$ \Lambda T x=\left\langle x, x^{*}\right\rangle \quad(x \in X) $$  Note that $\Lambda$ is well defined, for if $T x=T x^{\prime}$, then $x-x^{\prime} \in \mathcal{N}(T)$; hence  $$ \left\langle x-x^{\prime}, x^{*}\right\rangle=0 . $$  The open mapping theorem applies to  $$ T: X \rightarrow \mathscr{R}(T) $$  since $\mathscr{R}(T)$ is assumed to be a closed subspace of the complete space $Y$ and is therefore complete. It follows that there exists $K<\infty$ such that to each $y \in \mathscr{R}(T)$ corresponds an $x \in X$ with $T x=y,\|x\| \leq K\|y\|$, and  $$ |\Lambda y|=|\Lambda T x|=\left|\left\langle x, x^{*}\right\rangle\right| \leq K\|y\|\left\|x^{*}\right\| . $$  Thus $\Lambda$ is continuous. By the Hahn-Banach theorem, some $y^{*} \in Y^{*}$ extends $\Lambda$. Hence  $$ \left\langle T x, y^{*}\right\rangle=\Lambda T x=\left\langle x, x^{*}\right\rangle \quad(x \in X) . $$  This implies $x^{*}=T^{*} y^{*}$. Since $x^{*}$ was an arbitrary element of $\mathcal{N}(T)^{\perp}$, we have shown that $\mathscr{N}(T)^{\perp} \subset \mathscr{R}\left(T^{*}\right)$. Thus $(b)$ follows from $(a)$.  Suppose next that (c) holds. Let $Z$ be the closure of $\mathscr{R}(T)$ in $Y$. Define $S \in \mathscr{B}(X, Z)$ by setting $S x=T x$. Since $\mathscr{R}(S)$ is dense in $Z$, Corollary $(b)$ to Theorem 4.12 implies that  $$ S^{*}: Z^{*} \rightarrow X^{*} $$  is one-to-one.  If $z^{*} \in Z^{*}$, the Hahn-Banach theorem furnishes an extension $y^{*}$ of $z^{*}$; for every $x \in X$,  $$ \left\langle x, T^{*} y^{*}\right\rangle=\left\langle T x, y^{*}\right\rangle=\left\langle S x, z^{*}\right\rangle=\left\langle x, S^{*} z^{*}\right\rangle . $$  Hence $S^{*} z^{*}=T^{*} y^{*}$. It follows that $S^{*}$ and $T^{*}$ have identical ranges. Since $(c)$ is assumed to hold, $\mathscr{R}\left(S^{*}\right)$ is closed, hence complete.  Apply the open mapping theorem to  $$ S^{*}: Z^{*} \rightarrow \mathscr{R}\left(S^{*}\right) $$  Since $S^{*}$ is one-to-one, the conclusion is that there is a constant $c>0$ which satisfies  $$ c\left\|z^{*}\right\| \leq\left\|S^{*} z^{*}\right\| $$  for every $z^{*} \in Z^{*}$. Hence $S: X \rightarrow Z$ is an open mapping, by Theorem 4.13. In particular, $S(X)=Z$. But $\mathscr{R}(T)=\mathscr{R}(S)$, by the definition of $S$. Thus $\mathscr{R}(T)=Z$, a closed subspace of $Y$.  This completes the proof that $(c)$ implies $(a)$.","Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are Banach spaces, and $T \in \mathscr{B}(X, Y)$. Then

Since $T(U)$ has compact closure in $Y$ (as before, $U$ is the unit ball of $X$ ), Ascoli's theorem implies that $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ has a subsequence $\left\{f_{n_{i}}\right\}$ that converges uniformly on $T(U)$. Since  $$ \begin{aligned} \left\|T^{*} y_{n_{i}}^{*}-T^{*} y_{n_{j}}^{*}\right\| & =\sup \left|\left\langle T x, y_{n_{i}}^{*}-y_{n_{j}}^{*}\right\rangle\right| \\ & =\sup \left|f_{n_{i}}(T x)-f_{n_{j}}(T x)\right| \end{aligned} $$  the supremum being taken over $x \in U$, the completeness of $X^{*}$ implies that $\left\{T^{*} y_{n i}^{*}\right\}$ converges. Hence $T^{*}$ is compact.  The second half can be proved by the same method, but it may be more instructive to deduce it from the first half.

Then  $$ \left\langle y^{*}, \psi T x\right\rangle=\left\langle T x, y^{*}\right\rangle=\left\langle x, T^{*} y^{*}\right\rangle=\left\langle T^{*} y^{*}, \phi x\right\rangle=\left\langle y^{*}, T^{* *} \phi x\right\rangle $$  for all $x \in X$ and $y^{*} \in Y^{*}$, so that  $$ \psi T=T^{* *} \phi $$  If $x \in U$, then $\phi x$ lies in the unit ball $U^{* *}$ of $X^{* *}$. Thus  $$ \psi T(U) \subset T^{* *}\left(U^{* *}\right) $$  Now assume that $T^{*}$ is compact. The first half of the theorem shows that $T^{* *}: X^{* *} \rightarrow Y^{* *}$ is compact. Hence $T^{* *}\left(U^{* *}\right)$ is totally bounded, and so is its subset $\psi T(U)$. Since $\psi$ is an isometry, $T(U)$ is also totally bounded. Hence $T$ is compact.",

If (2) fails for every $r>0$, there exists $\left\{x_{n}\right\}$ in $M$ such that $\left\|x_{n}\right\|=1, S x_{n} \rightarrow 0$, and (after passage to a subsequence) $T x_{n} \rightarrow x_{0}$ for some $x_{0} \in X$.

This $m$ is called the Haar measure of $G$.","The operators $L_{s}$ satisfy $L_{s} L_{t}=L_{t s}$, because  $$ \left(L_{s} L_{t} f\right)(x)=\left(L_{t} f\right)(s x)=f(t s x)=\left(L_{t s} f\right)(x) $$  Since each $L_{s}$ is an isometry of $C(G)$ onto itself, $\left\{L_{s}: s \in G\right\}$ is an equicontinuous group of linear operators on $C(G)$. If $f \in C(G)$, let $K_{f}$ be the closure of $H_{L}(f)$. By Theorem 5.13, $K_{f}$ is compact. It is obvious that $L_{s}\left(K_{f}\right)=K_{f}$ for every $s \in G$. The fixed point theorem 5.11 now implies that $K_{f}$ contains a function $\phi$ such that $L_{s} \phi=\phi$ for every $s \in G$. In particular, $\phi(s)=\phi(e)$, so that $\phi$ is constant. By the definition of $K_{f}$, this constant can be uniformly approximated by functions in $H_{L}(f)$.  So far we have proved that to each $f \in C(G)$ corresponds at least one constant $c$ which can be uniformly approximated by convex combinations of left translates of $f$. Likewise, there is a constant $c^{\prime}$ which bears the same relation to the right translates of $f$. We claim that $c^{\prime}=c$.  To prove this, pick $\varepsilon>0$. There exist finite sets $\left\{a_{i}\right\}$ and $\left\{b_{j}\right\}$ in $G$, and there exist numbers $\alpha_{i}>0, \beta_{j}>0$, with $\sum \alpha=1=\sum \beta_{j}$, such that  $$ \left|c-\sum_{i} \alpha_{i} f\left(a_{i} x\right)\right|<\varepsilon \quad(x \in G) $$  and  $$ \left|c^{\prime}-\sum_{j} \beta_{j} f\left(x b_{j}\right)\right|<\varepsilon \quad(x \in G) $$  Put $x=b_{j}$ in (4); multiply (4) by $\beta_{j}$, and add with respect to $j$. The result is  $$ \left|c-\sum_{i, j} \alpha_{i} \beta_{j} f\left(a_{i} b_{j}\right)\right|<\varepsilon $$  Put $x=a_{i}$ in (5), multiply (5) by $\alpha_{i}$, and add with respect to $i$, to obtain  $$ \left|c^{\prime}-\sum_{i, j} \alpha_{i} \beta_{j} f\left(a_{i} b_{j}\right)\right|<\varepsilon $$  Now (6) and (7) imply that $c=c^{\prime}$.  It follows that to each $f \in C(G)$ corresponds a unique number, which we shall write $M f$, which can be uniformly approximated by convex combinations of left translates of $f$; the same $M f$ is also the unique number that can be uniformly approximated by convex combinations of right translates of $f$. The following properties of $M$ are obvious:  $$ \begin{aligned} M f & \geq 0 \quad \text { if } f \geq 0 \\ M 1 & =1 . \\ M(\alpha f) & =\alpha M f \quad \text { if } \alpha \text { is a scalar. } \\ M\left(L_{s} f\right) & =M f=M\left(R_{s} f\right) \quad \text { for every } s \in G \end{aligned} $$  We now prove that  $$ M(f+g)=M f+M g $$  Pick $\varepsilon>0$. Then  $$ \left|M f-\sum_{i} \alpha_{i} f\left(a_{i} x\right)\right|<\varepsilon \quad(x \in G) $$  for some finite set $\left\{a_{i}\right\} \subset G$ and for some numbers $\alpha_{i}>0$ with $\sum \alpha_{i}=1$. Define  $$ h(x)=\sum_{i} \alpha_{i} g\left(a_{i} x\right) $$  Then $h \in K_{g}$, hence $K_{h} \subset K_{g}$, and since each of these sets contains a unique constant function, we have $M h=M g$. Hence there is a finite set $\left\{b_{j}\right\} \subset G$, and there are numbers $\beta_{j}>0$ with $\sum \beta_{j}=1$, such that  $$ \left|M g-\sum_{j} \beta_{j} h\left(b_{j} x\right)\right|<\varepsilon \quad(x \in G) $$  by (14), this gives  $$ \left|M g-\sum_{i, j} \alpha_{i} \beta_{j} g\left(a_{i} b_{j} x\right)\right|<\varepsilon \quad(x \in G) $$  Replace $x$ by $b_{j} x$ in (13), multiply (13) by $\beta_{j}$, and add with respect to $j$, to obtain  $$ \left|M f-\sum_{i, j} \alpha_{i} \beta_{j} f\left(a_{i} b_{j} x\right)\right|<\varepsilon \quad(x \in G) $$  Thus  $$ \left|M f+M g-\sum_{i, j} \alpha_{i} \beta_{j}(f+g)\left(a_{i} b_{j} x\right)\right|<2 \varepsilon \quad(x \in G) $$  Since $\sum \alpha_{i} \beta_{j}=1,(18)$ implies (12).  The Riesz representation theorem, combined with (8), (9), (10), and (12), yields a regular Borel probability measure $m$ that satisfies  $$ M f=\int_{G} f d m \quad(f \in C(G)) $$  properties (1) and (2) follow now from (11).  To prove uniqueness, let $\mu$ be a regular Borel probability measure on $G$ which is left-invariant. Since $m$ is right-invariant, we have, for every $f \in C(G)$,  $$ \begin{aligned} \int_{G} f d \mu & =\int_{G} d m(y) \int_{G} f(y x) d \mu(x) \\ & =\int_{G} d \mu(x) \int_{G} f(y x) d m(y)=\int_{G} f d m . \end{aligned} $$  Hence $\mu=m$.  The proof of (3) is similar. Put $g(x)=f\left(x^{-1}\right)$. Then  $$ \int_{G} d m(y) \int_{G} g\left(x y^{-1}\right) d m(x)=\int_{G} d m(x) \int_{G} f\left(y x^{-1}\right) d m(y) $$  The two inner integrals are independent of $y$ and $x$, respectively. Hence $\int g d m=\int f d m$.","Let $G$ be a compact group, suppose $f \in C(G)$, and define $H_{L}(f)$ to be the convex hull of the set of all left translates of $f$: $s \rightarrow L_{s}$ f is a continuous map from $G$ into $C(G)$;Let $G$ be a compact group, suppose $f \in C(G)$, and define $H_{L}(f)$ to be the convex hull of the set of all left translates of $f$: the closure of $H_{L}(f)$ is compact in $C(G)$;  ;  ; "

Then $S$ is finite-dimensional.","Let $j$ be the identity map that takes $S$ into $L^{\infty}$, where $S$ is given the $L^{p}$-topology, so that $S$ is complete. If $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ is a sequence in $S$ such that $f_{n} \rightarrow f$ in $S$ and $f_{n} \rightarrow g$ in $L^{\infty}$, it is obvious that $f=g$ a.e. Hence $j$ satisfies the hypotheses of the closed graph theorem, and we conclude that there is a constant $K<\infty$ such that  $$ \|f\|_{\infty} \leq K\|f\|_{p} $$  for all $f \in S$. As usual, $\|f\|_{p}$ means $\left(\int|f|^{p} d \mu\right)^{1 / p}$, and $\|f\|_{\infty}$ is the essential supremum of $|f|$. If $p \leq 2$ then $\|f\|_{p} \leq\|f\|_{2}$. If $2<p<\infty$, integration of the inequality  $$ |f|^{p} \leq\|f\|_{\infty}^{p-2}|f|^{2} $$  leads to $\|f\|_{\infty} \leq K^{p / 2}\|f\|_{2}$. In either case, we have a constant $M<\infty$ such that  $$ \|f\|_{\infty} \leq M\|f\|_{2} \quad(f \in S) . $$  In the rest of the proof we shall deal with individual functions, not with equivalence classes modulo null sets.  Let $\left\{\phi_{1}, \ldots, \phi_{n}\right\}$ be an orthonormal set in $S$, regarded as a subspace of $L^{2}$. Let $Q$ be a countable dense subset of the euclidean unit ball $B$ of $\mathcal{C}^{n}$. If $c=\left(c_{1}, \ldots, c_{n}\right) \in B$, define $f_{c}=\sum c_{i} \phi_{i}$. Then $\left\|f_{c}\right\|_{2} \leq 1$, and so $\left\|f_{c}\right\|_{\infty} \leq M$. Since $Q$ is countable, there is a set $\Omega^{\prime} \subset \Omega$, with $\mu\left(\Omega^{\prime}\right)=1$, such that $\left|f_{c}(x)\right| \leq M$ for every $c \in Q$ and for every $x \in \Omega^{\prime}$. If $x$ is fixed, $c \rightarrow\left|f_{c}(x)\right|$ is a continuous function on $B$. Hence $\left|f_{c}(x)\right| \leq M$ whenever $c \in B$ and $x \in \Omega^{\prime}$. It follows that $\sum\left|\phi_{i}(x)\right|^{2} \leq$ $M^{2}$ for every $x \in \Omega^{\prime}$. Integration of this inequality gives $n \leq M^{2}$. We conclude that $\operatorname{dim} S \leq M^{2}$. This proves the theorem.",

Let $\mathscr{F}^{*}$ be the semigroup generated by the maps (1). Thus $\mathscr{F} *$ is the collection of all compositions of finitely many averages (1). If $f$, $g \in \mathscr{F}^{*}$, and $h=f \circ g=g \circ f$, then $h \in \mathscr{F}$. Since $f(g(K)) \subset f(K)$ and $g(f(K)) \subset g(K)$, we see that  $$ f(K) \cap g(K) \supset h(K) $$  Induction shows therefore that the collection $\{f(K): f \in \mathscr{F} *\}$ has the finite intersection property. Since each $f(K)$ is compact, there is a point $p \in K$ which lies in $f(K)$ for every $f \in \mathscr{F} *$.  Now fix $T \in \mathscr{F}$ and let $V$ be a neighborhood of 0 in $X$. For every $n \geq 1, p \in T_{n}(K)$, since $T_{n} \in \mathscr{F}^{*}$. This means that there exist points $x_{n} \in K$ such that  $$ p=\frac{1}{n}\left(x_{n}+T x_{n}+\cdots+T^{n-1} x_{n}\right) $$  But then  $$ p-T p=\frac{1}{n}\left(x_{n}-T^{n} x_{n}\right) \in \frac{1}{n}(K-K) $$  and $K-K \subset n V$ for all sufficiently large $n$, because $K-K$ is compact and therefore bounded.

The hypotheses of Theorem 5.24 are thus satisfied, with $X=\ell^{\infty}(G)$.

Both of these are in $K$. Since $\mu$ is extreme in $K$, $\mu=\sigma_{1}$. In other words,  $$ \frac{1}{2}(1+f) d \mu=\|\sigma\| d \mu $$  Therefore $f=2\|\sigma\|-1$ on $E$, i.e., $\left.f\right|_{E}$ is constant.  This proves our claim.

The construction described in Section 1.46 shows that there are functions $\phi_{i} \in \mathscr{D}(\Omega)$ such that $0 \leq \phi \leq 1, \phi_{i}=1$ in $V_{i}, \phi_{i}=0$ off $B_{i}$. Define $\psi_{1}=\phi_{1}$, and, inductively,  $$ \psi_{i+1}=\left(1-\phi_{1}\right) \cdots\left(1-\phi_{i}\right) \phi_{i+1} \quad(i \geq 1) $$  Obviously, $\psi_{i}=0$ outside $B_{i}$. This gives $(a)$. The relation  $$ \psi_{1}+\cdots+\psi_{i}=1-\left(1-\phi_{1}\right) \cdots\left(1-\phi_{i}\right) $$  is trivial when $i=1$. If (3) holds for some $i$, addition of (2) and (3) yields (3) with $i+1$ in place of $i$. Hence (3) holds for every $i$. Since $\phi_{i}=1$ in $V_{i}$, it follows that  $$ \psi_{1}(x)+\cdots+\psi_{m}(x)=1 \quad \text { if } x \in V_{1} \cup \cdots \cup V_{m} . $$  This gives $(b)$.

Then there is a function $f_{0} \in C^{(p)}(\Omega)$ such that $f_{0}(x)=f(x)$ for almost every $x \in \Omega$.

Note that the hypothesis involves no mixed derivatives, i.e., no terms like $D_{1} D_{2} f$. The conclusion is that $f$ can be ""corrected"" so as to be in $C^{(p)}(\Omega)$, by redefining it on a set of measure 0 .

Note also, as a corollary, that if all distribution derivatives of $f$ are locally $L^{2}$ in $\Omega$, then $f_{0} \in C^{\infty}(\Omega)$.","By hypothesis, there are functions $g_{i k}$, locally $L^{2}$ in $\Omega$, that satisfy  $$ \int_{\Omega} g_{i k} \phi d m_{n}=(-1)^{k} \int_{\Omega} f D_{i}^{k} \phi d m_{n} \quad[\phi \in \mathscr{D}(\Omega)] $$  for $1 \leq i \leq n, 0 \leq k \leq r$.  Let $\omega$ be an open set whose closure $K$ is a compact subset of $\Omega$. Choose $\psi \in \mathscr{D}(\Omega)$ so that $\psi=1$ on $K$, and define $F$ on $R^{n}$ by  $$ F(x)= \begin{cases}\psi(x) f(x) & \text { if } x \in \Omega \\ 0 & \text { if } x \notin \Omega\end{cases} $$  Then $F \in\left(L^{2} \cap L^{1}\right)\left(R^{n}\right)$.  In $\Omega$, the Leibniz formula gives  $$ D_{i}^{r} F=\sum_{s=0}^{r}\left(\begin{array}{l} r \\ s \end{array}\right)\left(D_{i}^{r-s} \psi\right)\left(D_{i}^{s} f\right)=\sum_{s=0}^{r}\left(\begin{array}{l} r \\ s \end{array}\right)\left(D_{i}^{r-s} \psi\right) g_{i s} $$  In the complement $\Omega_{0}$ of the support of $\psi, D_{i}^{r} F=0$. These two distributions coincide in $\Omega \cap \Omega_{0}$. Hence $D_{i}^{r} F$, originally defined as a distribution in $R^{n}$, is actually in $L^{2}\left(R^{n}\right)$, for $1 \leq i \leq n$, because the functions $\left(D_{i}^{r-s} \psi\right) g_{i s}$ are in $L^{2}(\Omega)$. [Having compact support, $D_{i}^{r} F$ is therefore also in $L^{1}\left(R^{n}\right)$.]  The Plancherel theorem, applied to $F$ and to $D_{1}^{r} F, \ldots, D_{n}^{r} F$, shows now that  $$ \int_{R^{n}}|\hat{F}|^{2} d m_{n}<\infty $$  and  $$ \int_{R^{n}} y_{i}^{2 r}|\hat{F}(y)|^{2} d m_{n}(y)<\infty \quad(1 \leq i \leq n) $$  Since  $$ (1+|y|)^{2 r}<(2 n+2)^{r}\left(1+y_{1}^{2 r}+\cdots+y_{n}^{2 r}\right) $$  where $|y|=\left(y_{1}^{2}+\cdots+y_{n}^{2}\right)^{1 / 2}$, (4) and (5) imply  $$ \int_{R^{n}}(1+|y|)^{2 r}|\hat{F}(y)|^{2} d m_{n}(y)<\infty $$  If $J$ denotes the integral (7), and if $\sigma_{n}$ is the $(n-1)$-dimensional volume of the unit sphere in $R^{n}$, the Schwarz inequality gives  $$ \begin{aligned} \left\{\int_{R^{n}}(1+|y|)^{p}|\hat{F}(y)| d m_{n}(y)\right\}^{2} & \leq J \int_{R^{n}}(1+|y|)^{2 p-2 r} d m_{n}(y) \\ & =J \sigma_{n} \int_{0}^{\infty}(1+t)^{2 p-2 r} t^{n-1} d t<\infty \end{aligned} $$  since $2 p-2 r+n-1<-1$. We have thus proved that  $$ \int_{R^{n}}(1+|y|)^{p}|\hat{F}(y)| d m_{n}(y)<\infty $$  Define  $$ F_{\omega}(x)=\int_{R^{n}} \hat{F}(y) e^{i x \cdot y} d m_{n}(y) \quad\left(x \in R^{n}\right) $$  By $(c)$ of the inversion theorem 7.7, $F_{\omega}=F$ a.e. on $R^{n}$. Moreover, (8) implies that $y^{\alpha} \hat{F}(y)$ is in $L^{1}$ whenever $|\alpha| \leq p$. Iteration of the proof of $(c)$ of Theorem 7.4 leads therefore to the conclusion  $$ F_{\omega} \in C^{(p)}\left(R^{n}\right) $$  in $\omega$.  Our given function $f$ coincides with $F$ in $\omega$. Hence $f=F_{\omega}$ a.e.  If $\omega^{\prime}$ is another set like $\omega$, the preceding proof gives a function $F_{\omega^{\prime}} \in C^{(p)}\left(R^{n}\right)$, which coincides with $f$ a.e. in $\omega^{\prime}$. Hence $F_{\omega^{\prime}}=F_{\omega}$ in $\omega^{\prime} \cap \omega$.

By $(a)$ of Theorem 8.9, $\phi_{0} u \in H^{t}$ for some $t$. Since $H^{t}$ becomes larger as $t$ decreases, we may assume that $t=s+N-k$, where $k$ is a positive integer. Choose closed balls  $$ B_{0} \supset B_{1} \supset \cdots \supset B_{k} $$  each centered at $x$, and each properly contained in the preceding one. Choose $\phi_{1}, \ldots, \phi_{k} \in \mathscr{D}(\Omega)$ so that $\phi_{i}=1$ on some open set containing $B_{i}$, and $\phi_{i}=0$ off $B_{i-1}$. Since $\phi_{0} u \in H^{t}$, the following ""bootstrap"" proposition implies that  $$ \phi_{1} u \in H^{t+1}, \ldots, \phi_{k} u \in H^{t+k} $$  It therefore leads to the conclusion that $u$ is locally $H^{s+N}$, because $t+k=s+N$ and $\phi_{k}=1$ on $B_{k}$.",;  ;  ;

When this condition is satisfied, (1) has a unique solution $u$ with compact support; the support of this $u$ lies in the convex hull of the support of $v$.","If (1) has a solution $u$ with compact support, $(a)$ of Theorem 7.23 shows that (2) holds with $g=\hat{u}$.  Conversely, suppose (2) holds for some entire $g$. Choose $r>0$ so that $v$ has its support in $r B=\left\{x \in R^{n}:|x| \leq r\right\}$. By Lemma 8.3, (2) implies  $$ |g(z)| \leq A \int_{T^{n}}|\hat{v}(z+w)| d \sigma_{n}(w) \quad\left(z \in \mathbb{C}^{n}\right) $$  By (a) of Theorem 7.23, there exist $N$ and $\gamma$ such that  $$ |\hat{v}(z+w)| \leq \gamma(1+|z+w|)^{N} \exp \{r|\operatorname{Im}(z+w)|\} $$  There are constants $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ that satisfy  $$ 1+|z+w| \leq c_{1}(1+|z|) $$  and  $$ |\operatorname{Im}(z+w)| \leq c_{2}+|\operatorname{Im} z| $$  for all $z \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$ and all $w \in T^{n}$. It follows from these inequalities that  $$ |g(z)| \leq B(1+|z|)^{N} \exp \{r|\operatorname{Im} z|\} \quad\left(z \in \mathbb{C}^{n}\right) $$  where $B$ is another constant (depending on $\gamma, A, N, c_{1}, c_{2}$, and $r$ ). By (7) and (b) of Theorem 7.23, $g=\hat{u}$ for some distribution $u$ with support in $r B$. Hence (2) becomes $P \hat{u}=\hat{v}$, which is equivalent to (1).  The uniqueness of $u$ is obvious, since there is at most one entire function $\hat{u}$ that satisfies $P \hat{u}=\hat{v}$.  The preceding argument showed that the support $S_{u}$ of $u$ lies in every closed ball centered at the origin that contains the support $S_{v}$ of $v$. Since (1) implies  $$ P(D)\left(\tau_{x} u\right)=\tau_{x} v \quad\left(x \in R^{n}\right) $$  the same statement is true of $x+S_{u}$ and $x+S_{v}$. Consequently, $S_{u}$ lies in the intersection of all closed balls (centered anywhere in $R^{n}$ ) that contain $S_{v}$. Since this intersection is the convex hull of $S_{v}$, the proof is complete.",; ; ;  ;  ;

for every $x \in R$, then there is a constant $A$ such that $\phi(x)=A$ except possibly in a set of Lebesgue measure 0.","Since $\mu$ is a probability measure, $\hat{\mu}(0)=1$. Suppose that $\hat{\mu}(t)=$ 1 for some $t \neq 0$. Since  $$ \hat{\mu}(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-i x t} d \mu(x) $$  it follows that $\mu$ must be concentrated on the set of all $x$ at which $e^{-i x t}=1$, that is, on the set of all integral multiples of $2 \pi / t$. But this is ruled out by the hypothesis of the theorem.  If $\sigma=\delta-\mu$, where $\delta$ is the Dirac measure, then $\hat{\sigma}=1-\hat{\mu}$.  Hence $\hat{\sigma}(t)=0$ if and only if $t=0$, and (1) can be written in the form  $$ \phi * \sigma=0 . $$  Put $g(x)=\exp \left(-x^{2}\right)$; put $K=g * \sigma$. Then $K \in L^{1}, \hat{K}(t)=0$ only if $t=0$, and (3) shows that $K * \phi=0$. By Theorem 9.3 (with the one-dimensional space generated by $K$ in place of $Y$ ) the distribution $\hat{\phi}$ has its support in $\{0\}$. Hence $\hat{\phi}$ is a finite linear combination of $\delta$ and its derivatives (Theorem 6.25), so that $\phi$ is a polynomial, in the distribution sense. Since nonconstant polynomials are not bounded on $R$, and since $\phi$ is assumed to be bounded, we have reached the desired conclusion.","If $\phi \in L^{\infty}\left(R^{n}\right), Y$ is a subspace of $L^{1}\left(R^{n}\right)$, and

Define  $$ K(x)=\sigma((- \infty, x))= \begin{cases}-\mu((- \infty, x)) & \text { if } x \leq 0 \\ \mu([x, \infty)) & \text { if } x>0\end{cases} $$  The assumption (2) guarantees that $K \in L^{1}(R)$. A straightforward computation, whose details we omit, shows that  $$ \int_{- \infty}^{\infty} K(x) e^{- i x t} d x= \begin{cases}\hat{\sigma}(t) / i t & \text { if } t \neq 0 \\ M & \text { if } t=0\end{cases} $$  and that  $$ \int_{r}^{s} f(x) d x=(K * \phi)(s)-(K * \phi)(r) \quad(- \infty<r<s<\infty) $$  since $f+\phi * \sigma$.  By (1), $\mu$ is not singular. The argument used at the beginning of the proof of Theorem 9.13 shows therefore that $\hat{\sigma}(t) \neq 0$ if $t \neq 0$. Hence (8) and (3) imply that $\hat{K}$ has no zero in $R$.  Since $f \in L^{1}(R),(9)$ implies that $K * \phi$ has limits at $\pm \infty$, whose difference is $\int_{- \infty}^{\infty} f$.  We shall show that $\phi$ is slowly oscillating. Once this is done, (5) and (6) follow from the properties of $K$ and $K * \phi$ that we just proved, by Pitt's theorem $(b)$ of 9.7 .  Repeated substitution of $\phi=f+\phi * \mu$ into its right-hand side gives  $$ \begin{aligned} \phi & =f+f * \mu+\cdots+f * \mu^{n-1}+\phi * \mu^{n} \\ & =f_{n}+g_{n}+h_{n} \quad(n=2,3,4, \ldots) \end{aligned} $$  where $\mu^{1}=\mu, \mu^{n}=\mu * \mu^{n-1}, f_{n}=f+\cdots+f * \mu^{n-1}$, and  $$ g_{n}=\phi *\left(\mu^{n}\right)_{a}, \quad h_{n}=\phi *\left(\mu^{n}\right)_{s} $$  For each $n, f_{n}(x) \rightarrow 0$ as $x \rightarrow \pm \infty$, and $g_{n}$ is uniformly continuous. Hence $f_{n}+g_{n}$ is slowly oscillating. Since the total variations satisfy  $$ \left\|\left(\mu^{n}\right)_{s}\right\| \leq\left\|\left(\mu_{s}\right)^{n}\right\| \leq\left\|\mu_{s}\right\|^{n} $$  we have  $$ \left|h_{n}(x)\right| \leq\|\phi\| \cdot\left\|\mu_{s}\right\|^{n} \quad(- \infty<x<\infty) $$  where $\|\phi\|$ is the supremum of $|\phi|$ on $R$. By (1), $\left\|\mu_{s}\right\|<1$. Hence $h_{n} \rightarrow 0$, uniformly on $R$. Consequently, $\phi$ is the uniform limit of the slowly oscillating functions $f_{n}+g_{n}$. This implies that $\phi$ is slowly oscillating, and completes the proof.","If $\mu$ is a Borel probability measure on $R$ whose support does not lie in any cyclic subgroup of $R$, and if $\phi$ is a bounded Borel function that satisfies the homogeneous equation

By Theorem 9.3, the support of the distribution $\hat{\phi}$ is therefore empty, hence $\hat{\phi}=0$ (Theorem 6.24), and since the Fourier transform maps $\mathscr{S}_{n}^{\prime}$ to $\mathscr{S}_{n}^{\prime}$ in a one-to-one fashion (Theorem 7.15), it follows that $\phi=0$ as a distribution.
