2.14,"If $X$ is a topological space, $Y$ is a Hausdorff space, and $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous, then the graph $G$ of $f$ is closed.","Let $\Omega$ be the complement of $G$ in $X \times Y$; fix $\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right) \in \Omega$. Then $y_{0} \neq f\left(x_{0}\right)$. Thus $y_{0}$ and $f\left(x_{0}\right)$ have disjoint neighborhoods $V$ and $W$ in $Y$. Since $f$ is continuous, $x_{0}$ has a neighborhood $U$ such that $f(U) \subset W$. The neighborhood $U \times V$ of $\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)$ lies therefore in $\Omega$. This proves that $\Omega$ is open."
2.15,"Suppose

(a) $X$ and $Y$ are $F$-spaces,

(b) $\Lambda: X \rightarrow Y$ is linear,

(c) $G=\{(x, \Lambda x): x \in X\}$ is closed in $X \times Y$.

Then $\Lambda$ is continuous.","$X \times Y$ is a vector space if addition and scalar multiplication are defined componentwise:

$$
\alpha\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)+\beta\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)=\left(\alpha x_{1}+\beta x_{2}, \alpha y_{1}+\beta y_{2}\right) .
$$

There are complete invariant metrics $d_{X}$ and $d_{Y}$ on $X$ and $Y$, respectively, which induce their topologies. If

$$
d\left(\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right),\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)\right)=d_{X}\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)+d_{Y}\left(y_{1}, y_{2}\right)
$$

then $d$ is an invariant metric on $X \times Y$ which is compatible with its product topology and which makes $X \times Y$ into an $F$-space. (The easy but tedious verifications that are needed here are left as an exercise.)

Since $\Lambda$ is linear, $G$ is a subspace of $X \times Y$. Closed subsets of complete metric spaces are complete. Therefore $G$ is an $F$-space.

Define $\pi_{1}: G \rightarrow X$ and $\pi_{2}: X \times Y \rightarrow Y$ by

$$
\pi_{1}(x, \Lambda x)=x, \quad \pi_{2}(x, y)=y .
$$

Now $\pi_{1}$ is a continuous linear one-to-one mapping of the $F$-space $G$ onto the $F$-space $X$. It follows from the open mapping theorem that

$$
\pi_{1}^{-1}: X \rightarrow G
$$

is continuous. But $\Lambda=\pi_{2} \circ \pi_{1}^{-1}$ and $\pi_{2}$ is continuous. Hence $\Lambda$ is continuous."
1.20,"If $X$ is a complex topological vector space and $f: \mathscr{C}^{n} \rightarrow X$ is linear, then $f$ is continuous.","Let $\left\{e_{1}, \ldots, e_{n}\right\}$ be the standard basis of $\mathscr{C}^{n}$ : The $k$ th coordinate of $e_{k}$ is 1 , the others are 0 . Put $u_{k}=f\left(e_{k}\right)$, for $k=1, \ldots, n$. Then $f(z)=z_{1} u_{1}+\cdots+z_{n} u_{n}$ for every $z=\left(z_{1}, \ldots, z_{n}\right)$ in $\mathscr{C}^{n}$. Every $z_{k}$ is a continuous function of $z$. The continuity of $f$ is therefore an immediate consequence of the fact that addition and scalar multiplication are continuous in $X$."

1.25 (a),"Suppose $d$ is a metric on a set $X$. A sequence $\left\{x_{n}\right\}$ in $X$ is a Cauchy sequence if to every $\varepsilon>0$ there corresponds an integer $N$ such that $d\left(x_{m}, x_{n}\right)<\varepsilon$ whenever $m>N$ and $n>N$. If every Cauchy sequence in $X$ converges to a point of $X$, then $d$ is said to be a complete metric on $X$.",
1.25 (b),Let $\tau$ be the topology of a topological vector space $X$. The notion of Cauchy sequence can be defined in this setting without reference to any metric: Fix a local base $\mathscr{B}$ for $\tau$. A sequence $\left\{x_{n}\right\}$ in $X$ is then said to be a Cauchy sequence if to every $V \in \mathscr{B}$ corresponds an $N$ such that $x_{n}-x_{m} \in V$ if $n>N$ and $m>N$.,It is clear that different local bases for the same $\tau$ give rise to the same class of Cauchy sequences.
1.25 (c),"Suppose now that $X$ is a topological vector space whose topology $\tau$ is compatible with an invariant metric $d$. Let us temporarily use the terms $d$-Cauchy sequence and $\tau$-Cauchy sequence for the concepts defined in $(a)$ and $(b)$, respectively. Since

$$
d\left(x_{n}, x_{m}\right)=d\left(x_{n}-x_{m}, 0\right)
$$

and since the $d$-balls centered at the origin form a local base for $\tau$, we conclude:

A sequence $\left\{x_{n}\right\}$ in $X$ is a d-Cauchy sequence if and only if is a $\tau$-Cauchy sequence.

Consequently, any two invariant metrics on $X$ that are compatible with $\tau$ have the same Cauchy sequences. They clearly also have the same convergent sequences (namely, the $\tau$-convergent ones). These remarks prove the following fact:

If $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ are invariant metrics on a vector space $X$ which induce the same topology on $X$, then

(a) $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ have the same Cauchy sequences, and

(b) $d_{1}$ is complete if and only if $d_{2}$ is complete.",Invariance is needed in the hypothesis (Exercise 12).
12.18,"If $E$ is a resolution of the identity, and if $x \in H$, then

4.21 (a),Let $M$ be a closed subspace of a topological vector space $X$ that is locally convex and has $\operatorname{dim} M<\infty$: then $M$ is complemented in $X$.,"Let $\left\{e_{1}, \ldots, e_{n}\right\}$ be a basis for $M$. Every $x \in M$ has then a unique representation

$$
x=\alpha_{1}(x) e_{1}+\cdots+\alpha_{n}(x) e_{n} .
$$

Each $\alpha_{i}$ is a continuous linear functional on $M$ (Theorem 1.21 and Lemma 1.20) which extends to a member of $X^{*}$, by the Hahn-Banach theorem. Let $N$ be the intersection of the null spaces of these extensions. Then $X=M \oplus N$."
4.21 (b),Let $M$ be a closed subspace of a topological vector space $X$ and $\operatorname{dim}(X / M)<\infty$: then $M$ is complemented in $X$.,"Let $\pi: X \rightarrow X / M$ be the quotient map, let $\left\{e_{1}, \ldots, e_{n}\right\}$ be a basis for $X / M$, pick $x_{i} \in X$ so that $\pi x_{i}=e_{i}(1 \leq i \leq n)$, and let $N$ be the vector space spanned by $\left\{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right\}$. Then $X=M \oplus N$."
4.22,"If $M$ is a subspace of a normed space $X$, if $M$ is not dense in $X$, and if $r>1$, then there exists $x \in X$ such that

","There exists $x_{1} \in X$ whose distance from $M$ is 1 , that is,

$$

Choose $y_{1} \in M$ such that $\left\|x_{1}-y_{1}\right\|<r$, and put $x=x_{1}-y_{1}$."
