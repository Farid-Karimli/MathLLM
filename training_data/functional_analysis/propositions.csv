If $X$ is locally convex and $\operatorname{dim} M<\infty$, then $M$ is complemented in $X$.","Let $\left\{e_{1}, \ldots, e_{n}\right\}$ be a basis for $M$. Every $x \in M$ has then a unique representation

$$

Each $\alpha_{i}$ is a continuous linear functional on $M$ (Theorem 1.21 and Lemma 1.20) which extends to a member of $X^{*}$, by the Hahn-Banach theorem. Let $N$ be the intersection of the null spaces of these extensions. Then $X=M \oplus N$."
4.21 (b),"Let $M$ be a closed subspace of a topological vector space $X$.

If $\operatorname{dim}(X / M)<\infty$, then $M$ is complemented in $X$.","Let $\pi: X \rightarrow X / M$ be the quotient map, let $\left\{e_{1}, \ldots, e_{n}\right\}$ be a basis for $X / M$, pick $x_{i} \in X$ so that $\pi x_{i}=e_{i}(1 \leq i \leq n)$, and let $N$ be the vector space spanned by $\left\{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right\}$.

$$
\inf \left\{\left\|x_{1}-y\right\|: y \in M\right\}=1

Choose $y_{1} \in M$ such that $\left\|x_{1}-y_{1}\right\|<r$, and put $x=x_{1}-y_{1}$."
12.19,"Suppose $E$ is a resolution of the identity. If $\omega_{n} \in \mathfrak{M}$ and $E\left(\omega_{n}\right)=0$ for $n=1,2,3, \ldots$, and if $\omega=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} \omega_{n}$, then $E(\omega)=0$.","Since $E\left(\omega_{n}\right)=0, E_{x, x}\left(\omega_{n}\right)=0$ for every $x \in H$. Since $E_{x, x}$ is countably additive, it follows that $E_{x, x}(\omega)=0$. But $\|E(\omega) x\|^{2}=$ $E_{x, x}(\omega)$. Hence $E(\omega)=0$."
10.6,"If $\phi$ is a complex homomorphism on a complex algebra $A$ with unit $e$, then $\phi(e)=1$, and $\phi(x) \neq 0$ for every invertible $x \in A$.","For some $y \in A, \phi(y) \neq 0$. Since

$$
\phi(y)=\phi(y e)=\phi(y) \phi(e)

13.18 (b),"Suppose $U$ is an operator in $H$ which is an isometry: $\|U x\| = \|x\|$ for every $x \in \mathscr{D}(U)$: If $\mathscr{R}(I-U)$ is dense in $H$, then $I-U$ is one-to-one","To prove $(b)$, suppose $x \in \mathscr{D}(U)$ and $(I-U) x=0$, that is, $x=U x$. Then

$$
(x,(I-U) y)=(x, y)-(x, U y)=(U x, U y)-(x, U y)=0
$$

for every $y \in \mathscr{D}(U)$. Thus $x \perp \mathscr{R}(I-U)$, so that $x=0$ if $\mathscr{R}(I-U)$ is dense in $H$."

$$
\|U x-U y\| = \|x-y\| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\|\{x, U x\}-\{y, U y\}\|

8.9 (a),Every distribution with compact support lies in some $H^{s}$.,"If $u \in \mathscr{D}^{\prime}\left(R^{n}\right)$ has compact support, (a) of Theorem 7.23 shows that

$$
|\hat{u}(y)| \leq C\left(1^{\cdot}+|y|\right)^{N} \quad\left(y \in R^{n}\right)
$$

for some constants $C$ and $N$. Hence $u \in H^{s}$ if $s<-N-n / 2$. This proves part $(a)"
8.9 (b),"If $-\infty<t<\infty$, the mapping $u \rightarrow v$ given by

$$
\hat{v}(y)=\left(1+|y|^{2}\right)^{t / 2} \hat{u}(y) \quad\left(y \in R^{n}\right)
$$

is a linear isometry of $H^{s}$ onto $H^{s-t}$ and is therefore an operator of order $t$ whose inverse has order $-t$.",
8.9 (c),"If $b \in L^{\infty}\left(R^{n}\right)$, the mapping $u \rightarrow v$ given by $\hat{v}=b \hat{u}$ is an operator of order 0 .",
8.9 (d),"For every multi-index $\alpha, D_{\alpha}$ is an operator of order $|\alpha|$.","The relation

\hat{u}(y)|
$$

implies

$$
\left\|D_{\alpha} u\right\|_{s-|\alpha|} \leq\|u\|_{s}
$$

so that $(d)$ holds."
8.9 (e),"If $f \in \mathscr{S}_{n}$, then $u \rightarrow f u$ is an operator of order 0 .","The proof of $(e)$ depends on the inequality

$$
\left(1+|x+y|^{2}\right)^{s} \leq 2^{|s|}\left(1+|x|^{2}\right)^{s}\left(1+|y|^{2}\right)^{|s|}
$$

valid for $x \in R^{n}, y \in R^{n},-\infty<s<\infty$. The case $s=1$ of (3) is obvious. From it the case $s=-1$ is obtained by replacing $x$ by $x-y$ and then $y$ by $-y$. The general case of (3) is obtained from these two by raising everything to the power $|s|$. It follows from (3) that

$$
\int_{R^{n}}|h(x-y)|^{2} d \mu_{s}(x) \leq 2^{|s|}\left(1+|y|^{2}\right)^{|s|} \int_{R^{n}}|h|^{2} d \mu_{s}
$$

for every measurable function $h$ on $R^{n}$.

Now suppose $u \in H^{s}, f \in \mathscr{S}_{n}, t>|s|+n / 2$. Since $\hat{f} \in \mathscr{S}_{n}, \|f\|_{t}<\infty$. Put $\gamma=\mu_{|s|-t}\left(R^{n}\right)$. Then $\gamma<\infty$. Define $F=|\hat{u}| *|\hat{f}|$. By Theorem 7.19,

$$
\left|(f u)^{\wedge}\right|=|\hat{u} * \hat{f}| \leq|\hat{u}| *|\hat{f}|=F .
$$

By the Schwarz inequality,

$$
|F(x)|^{2} \leq \int_{R^{n}}|\hat{f}(y)|^{2} d \mu_{t}(y) \int_{R^{n}}|\hat{u}(x-y)|^{2} d \mu_{-t}(y)
$$

for every $x \in R^{n}$. Integrate (6) over $R^{n}$, with respect to $\mu_{s}$. By (4), the result is

$$
\int_{R^{n}}|F|^{2} d \mu_{s} \leq 2^{|s|} \gamma\|f\|_{t}^{2}\|u\|_{s}^{2}
$$

It follows from (5) and (7) that

$$
\|f u\|_{s} \leq\left(2^{|s|} \gamma\right)^{1 / 2}\|f\|_{t}\|u\|_{s} .
$$

This proves $(e)$."
