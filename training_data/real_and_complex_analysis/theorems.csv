A third type of largeness is measure-theoretic: One can try to show that a certain set in a measure space is not empty by showing that it has positive measure or, better still, by showing that its complement has measure zero. Fubini's theorem often occurs in this type of argument.","Error, no proof value given."

Some finite collection of these $B$ 's covers $K$, and Lemma 7.3 gives us a disjoint subcollection, say $\left\{B_{1}, \ldots, B_{n}\right\}$, that satisfies

For example, (1) holds if $f$ is continuous at the point $x$. In general, (1) means that the averages of $|f-f(x)|$ are small on small balls centered at $x$. The Lebesgue points of $f$ are thus points where $f$ does not oscillate too much, in an average sense.

It is probably far from obvious that every $f \in L^{1}$ has Lebesgue points. But the following remarkable theorem shows that they always exist. (See also Exercise 23.)","Error, no proof value given."
4.10,"Every nonempty, closed, convex set $E$ in a Hilbert space $H$ contains a unique element of smallest norm.","An easy computation, using only the properties listed in Definition 4.1, establishes the identity

$$
\|x+y\|^{2}+\|x-y\|^{2}=2\|x\|^{2}+2\|y\|^{2} \quad(x \text { and } y \in H)
$$

This is known as the parallelogram law: If we interpret $\|x\|$ to be the length of the vector $x$, (1) says that the sum of the squares of the diagonals of a parallelogram is equal to the sum of the squares of its sides, a familiar proposition in plane geometry.

Let $\delta=\inf \{\|x\|: x \in E\}$. For any $x$ and $y \in E$, we apply (1) to $\frac{1}{2} x$ and $\frac{1}{2} y$ and obtain

$$
\frac{1}{4}\|x-y\|^{2}=\frac{1}{2}\|x\|^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\|y\|^{2}-\left\|\frac{x+y}{2}\right\|^{2}
$$

Since $E$ is convex, $(x+y) / 2 \in E$. Hence

$$
\|x-y\|^{2} \leq 2\|x\|^{2}+2\|y\|^{2}-4 \delta^{2} \quad(x \text { and } y \in E)
$$

If also $\|x\|=\|y\|=\delta$, then (3) implies $x=y$, and we have proved the uniqueness assertion of the theorem.

The definition of $\delta$ shows that there is a sequence $\left\{y_{n}\right\}$ in $E$ so that $\left\|y_{n}\right\| \rightarrow \delta$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Replace $x$ and $y$ in (3) by $y_{n}$ and $y_{m}$. Then, as $n \rightarrow \infty$ and $m \rightarrow \infty$, the right side of (3) will tend to 0 . This shows that $\left\{y_{n}\right\}$ is a Cauchy sequence. Since $H$ is complete, there exists an $x_{0} \in H$ so that $y_{n} \rightarrow x_{0}$, i.e., $\left\|y_{n}-x_{0}\right\| \rightarrow 0$, as $n \rightarrow \infty. Since $y_{n} \in E$ and $E$ is closed, $x_{0} \in E. Since the norm is a continuous function on $H$ (Theorem 4.6), it follows that

$$
\left\|x_{0}\right\|=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left\|y_{n}\right\|=\delta

(a) $f$ is differentiable at $x$ and $f^{\prime}(x)=A$.

(b) To every $\epsilon>0$ corresponds a $\delta>0$ such that

$$

is a Borel function, because the quantity in brackets decreases as $n$ increases and is, for each $n$, a lower semicontinuous function of $x$; the reasoning used in Sec. 7.2 proves this.

Choose $\lambda>0, \epsilon>0$. Since $\mu \perp m, \mu$ is concentrated on a set of Lebesgue measure 0 . The regularity of $\mu$ (Theorem 2.18) shows therefore that there is a compact set $K$, with $m(K)=0, \mu(K)>\|\mu\|-
\epsilon$.

Define $\mu_{1}(E)=\mu(K \cap E)$, for any Borel set $E \subset R^{k}$, and put $\mu_{2}=\mu-\mu_{1}$. Then $\left\|\mu_{2}\right\|<\epsilon$, and, for every $x$ outside $K$,

$$
(\bar{D} \mu)(x)=\left(\bar{D} \mu_{2}\right)(x) \leq\left(M \mu_{2}\right)(x) .
$$

Hence

$$
\{\bar{D} \mu>\lambda\} \subset K \cup\left\{M \mu_{2}>\lambda\right\},

$$
m\{\bar{D} \mu>\lambda\} \leq 3^{k} \lambda^{-1}\left\|\mu_{2}\right\|<3^{k} \lambda^{-1} \epsilon

Both $m_{k}$ and $m_{r} \times m_{s}$ are translation invariant Borel measures on $R^{k}$. They assign the same value to each $k$-cell. Hence they agree on $\mathscr{B}_{k}$, by Theorem $2.20(d)$.

$$
\left(m_{r} \times m_{s}\right)\left(Q-P_{1}\right) \leq\left(m_{r} \times m_{s}\right)\left(P_{2}-P_{1}\right)=m_{k}\left(P_{2}-P_{1}\right)=0

Thus $P\left(z_{1}\right)=0$ for some $z_{1}$. Consequently, there is a polynomial $Q$, of degree $n-1$, such that $P(z)=\left(z-z_{1}\right) Q(z)$. The proof is completed by induction on $n$."

The integrand is bounded by $2|f(x)|$ and tends to 0 for every $x$, as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Hence $\hat{f}\left(t_{n}\right) \rightarrow \hat{f}(t)$, by the dominated convergence theorem. Thus $\hat{f}$ is continuous.

Since $e^{\pi i}=-1,9.1(4)$ gives

Since (1) holds, the Minkowski inequality shows that $\left\|g_{k}\right\|_{p}<1$ for $k=1$, $2,3, \ldots$. Hence an application of Fatou's lemma to $\left\{g_{k}^{p}\right\}$ gives $\|g\|_{p} \leq 1$. In particular, $g(x)<\infty$ a.e., so that the series

There exists an $N$ such that $\left\|f_{n}-f_{m}\right\|_{p}<\epsilon$ if $n>N$ and $m>N$. For every $m>N$, Fatou's lemma shows therefore that

\int_{X}\left|f-f_{m}\right|^{p} d \mu \leq \lim _{i \rightarrow \infty} \inf _{X}\left|f_{n_{i}}-f_{i m}\right|^{p} d \mu \leq \epsilon^{p}

We conclude from (6) that $f-f_{m} \in L^{p}(\mu)$, hence that $f \in L^{p}(\mu)$ [since $f=$ $\left.\left(f-f_{m}\right)+f_{m}\right]$, and finally that $\left\|f-f_{m}\right\|_{p} \rightarrow 0$ as $m \rightarrow \infty$. This completes the proof for the case $1 \leq p<\infty$.

In $L^{\infty}(\mu)$ the proof is much easier. Suppose $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $L^{\infty}(\mu)$, let $A_{k}$ and $B_{m, n}$ be the sets where $\left|f_{k}(x)\right|>\left\|f_{k}\right\|_{\infty}$ and where $\left|f_{n}(x)-f_{m}(x)\right|>\left\|f_{n}-f_{m}\right\|_{\infty}$, and let $E$ be the union of these sets, for $k, m$, $n=1,2,3, \ldots$ Then $\mu(E)=0$, and on the complement of $E$ the sequence $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ converges uniformly to a bounded function $f$.

Then $f$ is representable by power series in $\Omega$.

","Suppose $D(a ; r) \subset \Omega$. Since

$$
\left|\frac{z-a}{\varphi(\zeta)-a}\right| \leq \frac{|z-a|}{r}<1

for every $z \in D(a ; r)$ and every $\zeta \in X$, the geometric series

$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(z-a)^{n}}{(\varphi(\zeta)-a)^{n+1}}=\frac{1}{\varphi(\zeta)-z}

converges uniformly on $X$, for every fixed $z \in D(a ; r)$. Hence the series (3) may be substituted into (1), and $f(z)$ may be computed by interchanging summation and integration. It follows that

f(z)=\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{\gamma} \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi-z} d \xi \quad(z \in D(a ; r))

But now we can apply Theorem 10.7, with $X=[0,2 \pi], \varphi=\gamma$, and $d \mu(t)=f(\gamma(t)) \gamma^{\prime}(t) d t$, and we conclude that there is a sequence $\left\{c_{n}\right\}$ such that

$$
f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{n}(z-a)^{n} \quad(z \in D(a ; r))

The uniqueness of $\left\{c_{n}\right\}$ (see the Corollary to Theorem 10.6) shows that the same power series is obtained for every $r<R$ (as long as $a$ is fixed). Hence the representation (2) is valid for every $z \in D(a ; R)$, and the proof is complete."
6.4,"If $\mu$ is a complex measure on $X$, then

$$
|\mu|(X)<\infty

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left|\mu\left(E_{i}\right)\right|>t
$$

for some $N$. Apply Lemma 6.3 , with $z_{i}=\mu\left(E_{i}\right)$, to conclude that there is a set $A \subset E$ (a union of some of the sets $E_{i}$ ) for which

$$
|\mu(A)|>t / \pi>1
$$

Setting $B=E-A$, it follows that

$$
|\mu(B)|=|\mu(E)-\mu(A)| \geq|\mu(A)|-|\mu(E)|>\frac{t}{\pi}-|\mu(E)|=1
$$

We have thus split $E$ into disjoint sets $A$ and $B$ with $|\mu(A)|>1$ and $|\mu(B)|>1$. Evidently, at least one of $|\mu|(A)$ and $|\mu|(B)$ is $\infty$, by Theorem 6.2.

Now if $|\mu|(X)=\infty$, split $X$ into $A_{1}, B_{1}$, as above, with $\left|\mu\left(A_{1}\right)\right|>1$, $|\mu|\left(B_{1}\right)=\infty$. Split $B_{1}$ into $A_{2}, B_{2}$, with $\left|\mu\left(A_{2}\right)\right|>1,|\mu|\left(B_{2}\right)=\infty$. Continuing in this way, we get a countably infinite disjoint collection $\left\{A_{i}\right\}$, with $\left|\mu\left(A_{i}\right)\right|>1$ for each $i$. The countable additivity of $\mu$ implies that

$$
\mu\left(\bigcup_{i} A_{i}\right)=\sum_{i} \mu\left(A_{i}\right)

The integrals (1) and (2) are unchanged, for every $x$, if we replace $f$ by $f_{0}$ and $g$ by $g_{0}$. Hence we may assume, to begin with, that $f$ and $g$ are Borel functions.

To apply Fubini's theorem, we shall first prove that the function $F$ defined by

$$
F(x, y)=f(x-y) g(y)
$$

is a Borel function on $R^{2}$.

Define $\varphi: R^{2} \rightarrow R^{1}$ and $\psi: R^{2} \rightarrow R^{1}$ by

$$
\varphi(x, y)=x-y, \quad \psi(x, y)=y
$$

Then $f(x-y)=(f \circ \varphi)(x, y)$ and $g(y)=(g \circ \psi)(x, y)$. Since $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are Borel functions, Theorem 1.12(d) shows that $f \circ \varphi$ and $g \circ \psi$ are Borel functions on $R^{2}$. Hence so is their product.

Next we observe that

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d y \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|F(x, y)| d x=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|g(y)| d y \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|f(x-y)| d x=\|f\|_{1}\|g\|_{1},
$$

since

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|f(x-y)| d x=\|f\|_{1}
$$

for every $y \in R^{1}$, by the translation-invariance of Lebesgue measure.

Thus $F \in L^{1}\left(R^{2}\right)$, and Fubini's theorem implies that the integral (2) exists for almost all $x \in R^{1}$ and that $h \in L^{1}\left(R^{1}\right)$. Finally,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\|h\|_{1} & =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|h(x)| d x \leq \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d x \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|F(x, y)| d y \\
& =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d y \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|F(x, y)| d x=\|f\|_{1}\|g\|_{1},

Suppose $C\left\{M_{n}\right\}$ is not quasi-analytic. Then there exists an $f \in C\left\{M_{n}\right\}$ such that $\left(D^{n} f\right)(0)=0$ for $n=0,1,2, \ldots$, but $f\left(x_{0}\right) \neq 0$ for some $x_{0}$. We may assume $x_{0}>0$. If $g(x)=f(x)$ for $x \geq 0 and $g(x)=0$ for $x<0$, then $g \in$ $C\left\{M_{n}\right\}$. Put $h(x)=g(x) g\left(2 x_{0}-x\right)$. By Theorem 19.7, $h \in C\left\{M_{n}\right\}$. Also, $h(x)=0$ if $x<0$ and if $x>2 x_{0}$. But $h\left(x_{0}\right)=f^{2}\left(x_{0}\right) \neq 0$. Thus $h$ is a nontrivial member of $C\left\{M_{n}\right\}$ with compact support."
6.2,The total variation $|\mu|$ of a complex measure $\mu$ on $\mathfrak{M}$ is a positive measure on $\mathfrak{M$},"Let $\left\{E_{i}\right\}$ be a partition of $E \in \mathfrak{M}$.

$$
\sum_{j}\left|\mu\left(A_{i j}\right)\right|>t_{i} \quad(i=1,2,3, \ldots)

$$
\sum_{i} t_{i} \leq \sum_{i, j}\left|\mu\left(A_{i j}\right)\right| \leq|\mu|(E) .

Taking the supremum of the left side of (2), over all admissible choices of $\left\{t_{i}\right\}$, we see that

$$
\sum_{i}|\mu|\left(E_{i}\right) \leq|\mu|(E) .
$$

To prove the opposite inequality, let $\left\{A_{j}\right\}$ be any partition of $E$. Then for any fixed $j,\left\{A_{j} \cap E_{i}\right\}$ is a partition of $A_{j}$, and for any fixed $i,\left\{A_{j} \cap E_{i}\right\}$ is a partition of $E_{i}$. Hence

$$

Since $w / 2 \pi i$ is an integer if and only if $e^{w}=1$, the first assertion of the theorem, namely, that $\operatorname{Ind}_{v}(z)$ is an integer, is equivalent to the assertion that $\varphi(\beta)=1$, where

Therefore $\varphi /(\gamma-z)$ is a continuous function on $[\alpha, \beta]$ whose derivative is zero in $[\alpha, \beta]-S$. Since $S$ is finite, $\varphi /(\gamma-z)$ is constant on $[\alpha, \beta]$; and since $\varphi(\alpha)=1$, we obtain

\varphi(t)=\frac{\gamma(t)-z}{\gamma(\alpha)-z} \quad(\alpha \leq t \leq \beta)

We now use the assumption that $\gamma$ is a closed path, i.e., that $\gamma(\beta)=\gamma(\alpha)$; (5) shows that $\varphi(\beta)=1$, and this, as we observed above, implies that $\operatorname{Ind}_{\nu}(z)$ is an integer.

By Theorem 10.7, (1) shows that $\operatorname{Ind}_{y} \in H(\Omega)$. The image of a connected set under a continuous mapping is connected ([26], Theorem 4.22), and since Ind $_{\gamma}$ is an integer-valued function, Ind $_{\gamma}$ must be constant on each component of $\Omega$.

Finally, (2) shows that $\left|\operatorname{Ind}_{y}(z)\right|<1$ if $|z|$ is sufficiently large. This implies that $\operatorname{Ind}_{\gamma}(z)=0$ in the unbounded component of $\Omega$.

Remark: If $\lambda(t)$ denotes the integral in (3), the preceding proof shows that $2 \pi \operatorname{Ind}_{y}(z)$ is the net increase in the imaginary part of $\lambda(t)$, as $t$ runs from $\alpha$ to $\beta$, and this is the same as the net increase of the argument of $\gamma(t)-z$. (We have not defined ""argument"" and will have no need for it.) If we divide this increase by $2 \pi$, we obtain ""the number of times that $\gamma$ winds around $z$,"" and this explains why the term ""winding number"" is frequently used for the index. One virtue of the preceding proof is that it establishes the main properties of the index without any reference to the (multiple-valued) argument of a complex number."

Then there is a sequence $\left\{P_{n}\right\}$ of polynomials such that $P_{n}(z) \rightarrow f(z)$ uniformly on $K","Since $S^{2}-K$ has now only one component, we need only one point $\alpha_{j}$ to apply Theorem 13.6, and we may take $\alpha_{j}=\infty$."
13.8,"The preceding result is false for every compact $K$ in the plane such that $S^{2}-K$ is not connected. For in that case $S^{2}-K$ has a bounded component $V$. Choose $\alpha \in V$, put $f(z)=(z-\alpha)^{-1}$, and put
$m=\max \{|z-\alpha|: \quad z \in K\}$. Suppose $P$ is a polynomial, such that $|P(z)-f(z)|<1 / m$ for all $z \in K$. Then

$$
|(z-\alpha) P(z)-1|<1 \quad(z \in K)

In particular, (1) holds if $z$ is in the boundary of $V$; since the closure of $V$ is compact, the maximum modulus theorem shows that (1) holds for every $z \in V$; taking $z=\alpha$, we obtain $1<1$. Hence the uniform approximation is not possible.

The same argument shows that none of the $\alpha_{j}$ can be dispensed with in Theorem 13.6.

We now apply the preceding approximation theorems to approximation in open sets. Let us emphasize that $K$ was not assumed to be connected in Theorems 13.6 and 13.7 and that $\Omega$ will not be assumed to be connected in the theorem which follows.","Error, no proof value given."

This is known as Jensen's formula. The hypothesis $f(0) \neq 0$ causes no harm in applications, for if $f$ has a zero of order $k$ at 0 , the formula can be applied to $f(z) / z^{k}$.","Order the points $\alpha_{j}$ so that $\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{m}$ are in $D(0 ; r)$ and $\left|\alpha_{m+1}\right|=$ $\cdots=\left|\alpha_{N}\right|=r$.

$$

Then $g \in H(D)$, where $D=D(0 ; r+\epsilon)$ for some $\epsilon>0, g$ has no zero in $D$, hence $\log |g|$ is harmonic in $D$ (Theorem 13.12), and so

$$
\log |g(0)|=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \log \left|g\left(r e^{i \theta}\right)\right| d \theta

By (2),

$$
|g(0)|=|f(0)| \prod_{n=1}^{m} \frac{r}{\left|\alpha_{n}\right|}

For $1 \leq n \leq m$, the factors in (2) have absolute value 1 if $|z|=r$. If $\alpha_{n}=r e^{i \theta_{n}}$ for $m<n \leq N$, it follows that

Pick $y>0$. Let $n$ be a positive integer. By Theorem 3.14, there exists $g \in C\left(R^{k}\right)$ so that $\|f-g\|_{1}<1 / n$ : Put $h=f-g$.

Since $g$ is continuous, $T g=0$. Since

$$
\left(T_{r} h\right)(x) \leq \frac{1}{m\left(B_{r}\right)} \int_{B(x, r)}|h| d m+|h(x)|

we have

$$
T h \leq M h+|h|

Since $T_{r} f \leq T_{r} g+T_{r} h$, it follows that

$$
T f \leq M h+|h|

Therefore

$$
\{T f>2 y\} \subset\{M h>y\} \cup\{|h|>y\} .

Denote the union on the right of (6) by $E(y, n)$. Since $\|h\|_{1}<1 / n$, Theorem 7.4 and the inequality $7.5(1)$ show that

The left side of (6) is independent of $n$. Hence

$$
\{T f>2 y\} \subset \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} E(y, n)
$$

This intersection has measure 0 , by (7), so that $\{T f>2 y\}$ is a subset of a set of measure 0 . Since Lebesgue measure is complete, $\{T f>2 y\}$ is Lebesgue measurable, and has measure 0 . This holds for every positive $y$. Hence $T f=0$ a.e. $[m]$."

The last equality depended on Cauchy's theorem; note that $h(0)=0$.

The length of $\gamma$ is less than $\pi \delta$, so (1) shows that the absolute value of the last integral in (3) is less than $C \delta \log (1 / \delta)$, where $C$ is a constant. This gives the result if $\delta \rightarrow 0$ in (3)."

To solve this, put

$$
g=\varphi_{\beta} \circ f \circ \varphi_{-\alpha} .

Since $\varphi_{-\alpha}$ and $\varphi_{\beta}$ map $U$ onto $U$, we see that $g \in H^{\infty}$ and $\|g\|_{\infty} \leq 1$; also, $g(0)=0. The passage from $f$ to $g$ has reduced our problem to the Schwarz lemma, which gives $\left|g^{\prime}(0)\right| \leq 1$. By (1), the chain rule gives

The compactness of $T$ implies then that there are open $\operatorname{discs} D_{1}, \ldots, D_{n}$ and functions $g_{j} \in H\left(D_{j}\right)$ such that the center of each $D_{j}$ is on $T$, such that $T \subset$ $D_{1} \cup \cdots \cup D_{n}$, and such that $g_{j}(z)=f(z)$ in $D_{j} \cap U$, for $j=1, \ldots, n$.

If $D_{i} \cap D_{j} \neq \varnothing$ and $V_{i j}=D_{i} \cap D_{j} \cap U$, then $V_{i j} \neq \varnothing$ (since the centers of the $D_{j}$ are on $T$ ), and $g_{i}=f=g_{j}$ in $V_{i j}$. Since $D_{i} \cap D_{j}$ is connected, it follows from Theorem 10.18 that $g_{i}=g_{j}$ in $D_{i} \cap D_{j}$. Hence we may define a function $h$ in $\Omega=U \cup D_{1} \cup \cdots \cup D_{n}$ by

$$
h(z)= \begin{cases}f(z) & (z \in U), \\ g_{i}(z) & \left(z \in D_{i}\right)\end{cases}

a grid of horizontal and vertical lines in the plane, such that the distance between any two adjacent horizontal lines is $\eta$, and likewise for the vertical lines. Let $Q_{1}, \ldots, Q_{m}$ be those squares (closed 2-cells) of edge $\eta$ which are formed by this grid and which intersect $K$. Then $Q_{r} \subset \Omega$ for $r=1, \ldots, m$.

If $a_{r}$ is the center of $Q_{r}$ and $a_{r}+b$ is one of its vertices, let $\gamma_{r k}$ be the oriented interval

$$
\operatorname{Ind}_{\partial Q_{r}}(\alpha)= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } \alpha \text { is in the interior of } Q_{r} \\ 0 & \text { if } \alpha \text { is not in } Q_{r}\end{cases}
$$

Let $\Sigma$ be the collection of all $\gamma_{r k}(1 \leq r \leq m, 1 \leq k \leq 4)$. It is clear that $\Sigma$ is balanced. Remove those members of $\Sigma$ whose opposites (see Sec. 10.8) also belong to $\Sigma$. Let $\Phi$ be the collection of the remaining members of $\Sigma$. Then $\Phi$ is balanced. Let $\Gamma$ be the cycle constructed from $\Phi$, as in Sec. 13.4.

If an edge $E$ of some $Q_{r}$ intersects $K$, then the two squares in whose boundaries $E$ lies intersect $K$. Hence $\Sigma$ contains two oriented intervals which are each other's opposites and whose range is $E$. These intervals do not occur in $\Phi$. Thus $\Gamma$ is a cycle in $\Omega-K$.

The construction of $\Phi$ from $\Sigma$ shows also that

$$
\operatorname{Ind}_{\Gamma}(\alpha)=\sum_{r=1}^{m} \operatorname{Ind}_{\partial Q_{r}}(\alpha)
$$

if $\alpha$ is not in the boundary of any $Q_{r}$. Hence (4) implies

$$
\operatorname{Ind}_{\Gamma}(\alpha)= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } \alpha \text { is in the interior of some } Q_{r} \\ 0 & \text { if } \alpha \text { lies in no } Q_{r}\end{cases}

If $z \in K$, then $z \notin \Gamma^{*}$, and $z$ is a limit point of the interior of some $Q_{r}$. Since the left side of (6) is constant in each component of the complement of $\Gamma^{*},(6)$ gives

In this way we obtain the desired $P_{\alpha}$ 's. The Mittag-Leffler theorem now gives us a meromorphic $h$ in $\Omega$ whose principal parts are these $P_{\alpha}$ 's, and if we put $f=g h$ we obtain a function with the desired properties.

7.15,"If $\mu$ is a positive Borel measure on $R^{k}$ and $\mu \perp m$, then

For $N=1,2,3, \ldots$, let $E_{N}$ be the set of all $x \in S$ to which correspond radii $r_{i}=r_{i}(x)$, with $\lim r_{i}=0$, such that

$$
\mu\left(B\left(x, r_{i}\right)\right)<N m\left(B\left(x, r_{i}\right)\right)
$$

Then (1) holds for every $x \in S-\bigcup_{N} E_{N}$.

Fix $N$ and $j$, for the moment. Every $x \in E_{N}$ is then the center of a ball $B_{x} \subset V_{j}$ that satisfies (2). Let $\beta_{x}$ be the open ball with center $x$ whose radius is $1 / 3$ of that of $B_{x}$. The union of these balls $\beta_{x}$ is an open set $W_{j, N}$ that contains $E_{N}$ and lies in $V_{j}$. We claim that

$$
\mu\left(W_{j, N}\right)<3^{k} N / j
$$

To prove (3), let $K \subset W_{j, N}$ be compact. Finitely many $\beta_{x}$ cover $K$. Lemma 7.3 shows therefore that there is a finite set $F \subset E_{N}$ with the following properties:

(a) $\left\{\beta_{x}: x \in F\right\}$ is a disjoint collection, and

(b) $K \subset \bigcup_{x \in F} B_{x}$.

Thus

$$

\mu(K) & \leq \sum_{x \in F} \mu\left(B_{x}\right)<N \sum_{x \in F} m\left(B_{x}\right) \\

Now put $\Omega_{N}=\bigcap_{j} W_{j, N}$. Then $E_{N} \subset \Omega_{N}, \Omega_{N}$ is a $G_{\delta}, \mu\left(\Omega_{N}\right)=0$, and $(D \mu)(x)=\infty$ at every point of $S-\bigcup_{N} \Omega_{N}$."

$$
\Phi(f)=\int_{x} f g d \mu \quad\left(f \in L^{p}(\mu)\right)
$$

Moreover, if $\Phi$ and $g$ are related as in (1), we have

$$
\|\Phi\|=\|g\|_{q} \text {. }
$$

In other words, $L^{q}(\mu)$ is isometrically isomorphic to the dual space of $L^{p}(\mu)$, under the stated conditions.","The uniqueness of $g$ is clear, for if $g$ and $g^{	ext{prime}}$ satisfy (1), then the integral of $g-g^{	ext{prime}}$ over any measurable set $E$ of finite measure is 0 (as we see by taking $\chi_{E}$ for $f$ ), and the $\sigma$-finiteness of $\mu$ implies therefore that $g-g^{	ext{prime}}=0$ a.e.

Next, if (1) holds, H\""{o}lder's inequality implies

$$
\|\Phi\| \leq\|g\|_{q} .
$$

So it remains to prove that $g$ exists and that equality holds in (3). If $\|\Phi\|=0$, (1) and (2) hold with $g=0$. So assume $\|\Phi\|>0$.

We first consider the case $\mu(X)<\infty$.

For any measurable set $E \subset X$, define

$$
\lambda(E)=\Phi\left(\chi_{E}\right) .
$$

Since $\Phi$ is linear, and since $\chi_{A \cup B}=\chi_{A}+\chi_{B}$ if $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, we see that $\lambda$ is additive. To prove countable additivity, suppose $E$ is the union of countably many disjoint measurable sets $E_{i}$, put $A_{k}=E_{1} \cup \cdots \cup E_{k}$, and note that

$$
\left\|\chi_{E}-\chi_{A_{k}}\right\|_{p}=\left[\mu\left(E-A_{k}\right)\right]^{1 / p} \rightarrow 0 \quad(k \rightarrow \infty)
$$

the continuity of $\Phi$ shows now that $\lambda\left(A_{k}\right) \rightarrow \lambda(E)$. So $\lambda$ is a complex measure. [In (4) the assumption $p<\infty$ was used.] It is clear that $\lambda(E)=0$ if $\mu(E)=0$,
since then $\left\|\chi_{E}\right\|_{p}=0$. Thus $\lambda \ll \mu$, and the Radon-Nikodym theorem ensures the existence of a function $g \in L^{1}(\mu)$ such that, for every measurable $E \subset X$,

$$
\Phi\left(\chi_{E}\right)=\int_{E} g d \mu=\int_{X} \chi_{E} g d \mu
$$

By linearity it follows that

$$
\Phi(f)=\int_{X} f g d \mu
$$

holds for every simple measurable $f$, and so also for every $f \in L^{\infty}(\mu)$, since every $f \in L^{\infty}(\mu)$ is a uniform limit of simple functions $f_{i}$. Note that the uniform convergence of $f_{i}$ to $f$ implies $\left\|f_{i}-f\right\|_{p} \rightarrow 0$, hence $\Phi\left(f_{i}\right) \rightarrow \Phi(f)$, as $i \rightarrow \infty$.

We want to conclude that $g \in L^{q}(\mu)$ and that (2) holds; it is best to split the argument into two cases.

CASE $1 p=1$. Here (5) shows that

$$
\left|\int_{E} g d \mu\right| \leq\|\Phi\| \cdot\left\|\chi_{E}\right\|_{1}=\|\Phi\| \cdot \mu(E)
$$

for every $E \in \mathfrak{M}$. By Theorem 1.40, $|g(x)| \leq\|\Phi\|$ a.e., so that $\|g\|_{\infty} \leq\|\Phi\|$.

CASE $21<p<\infty$. There is a measurable function $\alpha,|\alpha|=1$, such that $\alpha g=|g|$ [Proposition 1.9(e)]. Let $E_{n}=\{x:|g(x)| \leq n\}$, and define $f=$ $\chi_{E_{n}}|g|^{q-1} \alpha$. Then $|f|^{p}=|g|^{q}$ on $E_{n}, f \in L^{\infty}(\mu)$, and (6) gives

$$
\int_{E_{n}}|g|^{q} d \mu=\int_{X} f g d \mu=\Phi(f) \leq\|\Phi\|\left\{\int_{E_{n}}|g|^{q}\right\}^{1 / p},
$$

so that

$$
\int_{X} \chi_{E_{n}}|g|^{q} d \mu \leq\|\Phi\|^{q} \quad(n=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

If we apply the monotone convergence theorem to (7), we obtain $\|g\|_{a} \leq\|\Phi\|$.

Thus (2) holds and $g \in L^{q}(\mu)$. It follows that both sides of (6) are continuous functions on $L^{p}(\mu)$. They coincide on the dense subset $L^{\infty}(\mu)$ of $L^{p}(\mu)$; hence they coincide on all of $L^{p}(\mu)$, and this completes the proof if $\mu(X)<\infty$.

If $\mu(X)=\infty$ but $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, choose $w \in L^{1}(\mu)$ as in Lemma 6.9. Then $d \tilde{\mu}=w d \mu$ defines a finite measure on $\mathfrak{M}$, and

$$
F \rightarrow w^{1 / p} F
$$

is a linear isometry of $L^{p}(\tilde{\mu})$ onto $L^{p}(\mu)$, because $w(x)>0$ for every $x \in X. Hence

$$
\Psi(F)=\Phi\left(w^{1 / p} F\right)
$$

defines a bounded linear functional $\Psi$ on $L^{p}(\tilde{\mu})$, with $\|\Psi\|=\|\Phi\|$.

The first part of the proof shows now that there exists $G \in L^{q}(\tilde{\mu})$ such that

$$
\Psi(F)=\int_{X} F G d \tilde{\mu} \quad\left(F \in L^{p}(\tilde{\mu})\right)
$$

Put $g=w^{1 / q} G$. (If $p=1, g=G$.) Then

$$
\int_{X}|g|^{q} d \mu=\int_{X}|G|^{q} d \tilde{\mu}=\|\Psi\|^{q}=\|\Phi\|^{q}
$$

if $p>1$, whereas $\|g\|_{\infty}=\|G\|_{\infty}=\|\Psi\|=\|\Phi\|$ if $p=1. Thus (2) holds, and since $G d \tilde{\mu}=w^{1 / p} g d \mu$, we finally get

$$
\Phi(f)=\Psi\left(w^{-1 / p} f\right)=\int_{X} w^{-1 / p} f G d \tilde{\mu}=\int_{X} f g d \mu

Let $X$ be a measure space, with a positive measure $\mu$, and suppose $\left\{\psi_{n}\right\}$ $(n=1,2,3, \ldots)$ is an orthonormal set of functions in $L^{2}(\mu)$; we recall what this means:

$$
\int_{X} \psi_{n} \bar{\psi}_{m} d \mu= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } m=n \\ 0 & \text { if } m \neq n\end{cases}
$$

Let us also assume that $\left\{\psi_{n}\right\}$ is a bounded sequence in $L^{\infty}(\mu)$ : There exists an $M<\infty$ such that

$$
\left|\psi_{n}(x)\right| \leq M \quad(n=1,2,3, \ldots ; x \in X)
$$

$$
\hat{f}(n)=\int_{X} f \bar{\psi}_{n} d \mu \quad(n=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

exist and define a function $\hat{f}$ on the set of all positive integers.

There are now two very easy theorems: For $f \in L^{1}(\mu)$, (2) gives

$$
\|\hat{f}\|_{\infty} \leq M\|f\|_{1}
$$

and for $f \in L^{2}(\mu)$, the Bessel inequality gives

$$
\|\hat{f}\|_{2} \leq\|f\|_{2}

$$
\|f\|_{p}=\left[\int|f|^{p} d \mu\right]^{1 / p}, \quad\|\hat{f}\|_{q}=\left[\sum|\hat{f}(n)|^{q}\right]^{1 / q}
$$

and $\|\hat{f}\|_{\infty}=\sup _{n}|\hat{f}(n)|$.

Since $(1, \infty)$ and $(2,2)$ are pairs of conjugate exponents, one may conjecture that $\|\hat{f}\|_{q}$ is finite whenever $f \in L^{p}(\mu)$ and $1<p<2, q=p /(p-1)$.

Then $g_{1}=g_{0}$.","Fix $t \in I$. There is a chain $\mathscr{C}=\left\{A_{0}, \ldots, A_{n}\right\}$ which covers $\gamma_{t}$, with $A_{0}=D$, such that $\left(g_{t}, D_{t}\right)$ is obtained by continuation of $(f, D)$ along $\mathscr{C}$.

$$
E_{i}=\gamma_{t}\left(\left[s_{i}, s_{i+1}\right]\right) \subset A_{i} \quad(i=0,1, \ldots, n-1)
$$

There exists an $\epsilon>0$ which is less than the distance from any of the compact sets $E_{i}$ to the complement of the corresponding open disc $A_{i}$. The uniform continuity of $\varphi$ on $I^{2}$ (see Definition 16.12) shows that there exists a $\delta>0$ such that

$$
\left|\gamma_{t}(s)-\gamma_{u}(s)\right|<\epsilon \quad \text { if } s \in I, u \in I,|u-t|<\delta \text {. }

Suppose $u$ satisfies these conditions. Then (2) shows that $\mathscr{C}$ covers $\gamma_{u}$, and therefore Theorem 16.11 shows that both $g_{t}$ and $g_{u}$ are obtained by continuation of $(f, D)$ along this same chain $\mathscr{C}$. Hence $g_{t}=g_{u}$.

Thus each $t \in I$ is covered by a segment $J_{t}$ such that $g_{u}=g_{t}$ for all $u \in$ $I \cap J_{t}$. Since $I$ is compact, $I$ is covered by finitely many $J_{t}$; and since $I$ is connected, we see in a finite number of steps that $g_{1}=g_{0}$."

$\log |g|$ are 0 a.e. (Theorem 11.22). Since $\left|B^{*}\right|=1$ a.e., we see that $M$ is an inner function.

Conversely, let $B$ be the Blaschke product formed with the zeros of a given inner function $M$ and put $g=M / B$. Then $\log |g|$ is harmonic in $U$. Theorems 15.24 and 17.9 show that $|g| \leq 1$ in $U$ and that $\left|g^{*}\right|=1$ a.e. on $T$. Thus $\log |g| \leq 0. We conclude from Theorem 11.30 that $\log |g|$ is the Poisson integral of $-d \mu$, for some positive measure $\mu$ on $T$. Since $\log \left|g^{*}\right|=0$ a.e. on $T, we have $D \mu=0$ a.e. on $T, so $\mu$ is singular. Finally, $\log |g|$ is the real part of

The theorem asserts that $f$ can be extended to a function which is holomorphic in a region symmetric with respect to the real axis, and (3) states that $F$ preserves this symmetry. Note that the continuity hypothesis (2) is merely imposed on the imaginary part of $f$.","Put $\Omega=\Omega^{+} \cup L \cup \Omega^{-}$. We extend $v$ to $\Omega$ by defining $v(z)=0$ for $z \in L$ and $v(z)=-v(\bar{z})$ for $z \in \Omega^{-}$. It is then inmediate that $v$ is continuous and that $v$ has the mean value property in $\Omega$, so that $v$ is harmonic in $\Omega$, by Theorem 11.13 .

Hence $v$ is locally the imaginary part of a holomorphic function. This means that to each of the discs $D_{t}$ there corresponds an $f_{t} \in H\left(D_{t}\right)$ such that $\operatorname{Im} f_{t}=v$. Each $f_{t}$ is determined by $v$ up to a real additive constant. If this constant is chosen so that $f_{t}(z)=f(z)$ for some $z \in D_{t} \cap \Pi^{+}$, the same will hold for all $z \in D_{t} \cap \Pi^{+}$, since $f-f_{t}$ is constant in the region $D_{t} \cap \Pi^{+}$. We assume that the functions $f_{t}$ are so adjusted.

The power series expansion of $f_{t}$ in powers of $z-t$ has only real coefficients, since $v=0$ on $L$, so that all derivatives of $f_{t}$ are real at $t$. It follows that

$$
f_{t}(\bar{z})=\overline{f_{t}(z)} \quad\left(z \in D_{t}\right)
$$

Next, assume that $D_{s} \cap D_{t} \neq \varnothing$. Then $f_{t}=f=f_{s}$ in $D_{t} \cap D_{s} \cap \Pi^{+}$; and since $D_{t} \cap D_{s}$ is connected, Theorem 10.18 shows that

$$
f_{t}(z)=f_{s}(z) \quad\left(z \in D_{t} \cap D_{s}\right)
$$

Thus it is consistent to define

$$
F(z)= \begin{cases}f(z) & \text { for } z \in \Omega^{+} \\ f_{t}(z) & \text { for } z \in D_{t} \\ \frac{f(\bar{z})}{} & \text { for } z \in \Omega^{-}\end{cases}

$$
f(\bar{z})=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{n}(\bar{z}-\bar{a})^{n}

To avoid this (admittedly very minor) problem, we shall keep integration on the circle in what follows, and will write the Poisson integral $u=P[d \mu]$ of $\mu$ in the form

Note that differentiability is assumed to hold at every point of $[a, b]$","It is clear that it is enough to prove this for $x=b$. Fix $\epsilon>0$. Theorem 2.25 ensures the existence of a lower semicontinuous function $g$ on $[a, b]$ such that $g>f^{\prime}$ and

$$
\int_{a}^{b} g(t) d t<\int_{a}^{b} f^{\prime}(t) d t+\epsilon
$$

Actually, Theorem 2.25 only gives $g \geq f^{\prime}$, but since $m([a, b])<\infty$, we can add a small constant to $g$ without affecting (2). For any $\eta>0$, define

$$
F_{\eta}(x)=\int_{a}^{x} g(t) d t-f(x)+f(a)+\eta(x-a) \quad(a \leq x \leq b) .
$$

Keep $\eta$ fixed for the moment. To each $x \in[a, b)$ there corresponds a $\delta_{x}>0$ such that

$$
g(t)>f^{\prime}(x) \text { and } \frac{f(t)-f(x)}{t-x}<f^{\prime}(x)+\eta
$$

for all $t \in\left(x, x+\delta_{x}\right)$, since $g$ is lower semicontinuous and $g(x)>f^{\prime}(x)$. For any such $t$ we therefore have

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{\eta}(t)-F_{\eta}(x) & =\int_{x}^{t} g(s) d s-[f(t)-f(x)]+\eta(t-x) \\
& >(t-x) f^{\prime}(x)-(t-x)\left[f^{\prime}(x)+\eta\right]+\eta(t-x)=0 .
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $F_{\eta}(a)=0$ and $F_{\eta}$ is continuous, there is a last point $x \in[a, b]$ at which $F_{\eta}(x)=0$. If $x<b$, the preceding computation implies that $F_{\eta}(t)>0$ for $t \in(x, b]$. In any case, $F_{\eta}(b) \geq 0$. Since this holds for every $\eta>0$, (2) and (3) now give

$$
f(b)-f(a) \leq \int_{a}^{b} g(t) d t<\int_{a}^{b} f^{\prime}(t) d t+\epsilon
$$

and since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary, we conclude that

$$
f(b)-f(a) \leq \int_{a}^{b} f^{\prime}(t) d t
$$

If $f$ satisfies the hypotheses of the theorem, so does $-f$; therefore (6) holds with $-f$ in place of $f$, and these two inequalities together give (1)."

$$

if $|z| \leq r$. Hence Theorem 15.6 shows that $B \in H(U)$ and that $B$ has only the prescribed zeros. Since each factor in (2) has absolute value less than 1 in $U$, it follows that $|B(z)|<1$, and the proof is complete."
15.22,"The preceding theorem shows that

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(1-\left|\alpha_{n}\right|\right)<\infty
$$

is a sufficient condition for the existence of an $f \in H^{\infty}$ which has only the prescribed zeros $\left\{\alpha_{n}\right\}$. This condition also turns out to be necessary: If $f \in H^{\infty}$ and $f$ is not identically zero, the zeros of $f$ must satisf $y$ (1). This is a special case of Theorem 15.23. It is interesting that (1) is a necessary condition in a much larger class of functions, which we now describe.

For any real number $t$, define $\log ^{+} t=\log t$ if $t \geq 1$ and $\log ^{+} t=0$ if $t<1$. We let $N$ (for Nevanlinna) be the class of all $f \in H(U)$ for which

$$
\sup _{0<r<1} \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \log ^{+}\left|f\left(r e^{i \theta}\right)\right| d \theta<\infty
$$

It is clear that $H^{\infty} \subset N$. Note that (2) imposes a restriction on the rate of growth of $|f(z)|$ as $|z| \rightarrow 1$, whereas the boundedness of the integrals

$$
\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \log \left|f\left(r e^{i \theta}\right)\right| d \theta
$$

imposes no such restriction. For instance, (3) is independent of $r$ if $f=e^{g}$ for any $g \in H(U)$. The point is that (3) can stay small because $\log |f|$ assumes large negative values as well as large positive ones, whereas $\log ^{+}|f| \geq 0$. The class $N$ will be discussed further in Chap. 17.","Error, no proof value given."
4.18,"Let $\left\{u_{\alpha}: \alpha \in A\right\}$ be an orthonormal set in $H$. Each of the following four conditions on $\left\{u_{\alpha}\right\}$ implies the other three:

(i) $\left\{u_{\alpha}\right\}$ is a maximal orthonormal set in $H$.

(ii) The set $P$ of all finite linear combinations of members of $\left\{u_{\alpha}\right\}$ is dense in $H$.

(iii) The equality

$$
\sum_{\alpha \in A}|\hat{x}(\alpha)|^{2}=\|x\|^{2}
$$

holds for every $x \in H$.

(iv) The equality

$$
\sum_{\alpha \in A} \hat{x}(\alpha) \overline{\hat{y}(\alpha)}=(x, y)
$$

holds for all $x \in H$ and $y \in H$.

The last formula is known as Parseval's identity. Observe that $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ are in $\ell^{2}(A)$, hence $\hat{x} \bar{y}$ is in $\ell^{1}(A)$, so that the sum in (iv) is well defined. Of course, (iii) is the special case $x=y$ of (iv).

Maximal orthonormal sets are often called complete orthonormal sets or orthonormal bases.","To say that $\left\{u_{\alpha}\right\}$ is maximal means simply that no vector of $H$ can be adjoined to $\left\{u_{\alpha}\right\}$ in such a way that the resulting set is still orthonormal. This happens precisely when there is no $x \neq 0$ in $H$ that is orthogonal to every $u_{\alpha}$.

We shall prove that (i) $\rightarrow$ (ii) $\rightarrow$ (iii) $\rightarrow$ (iv) $\rightarrow$ (i).

If $P$ is not dense in $H$, then its closure $\bar{P}$ is not all of $H$, and the corollary to Theorem 4.11 implies that $P^{\perp}$ contains a nonzero vector. Thus $\left\{u_{\alpha}\right\}$ is not maximal when $P$ is not dense, and (i) implies (ii).

If (ii) holds, so does (iii), by Theorem 4.17.

The implication (iii) $\rightarrow$ (iv) follows from the easily proved Hilbert space identity (sometimes called the ""polarization identity"")

$$
4(x, y)=\|x+y\|^{2}-\|x-y\|^{2}+i\|x+i y\|^{2}-i\|x-i y\|^{2}
$$

which expresses the inner product $(x, y)$ in terms of norms and which is equally valid with $\hat{x}, \hat{y}$ in place of $x, y$, simply because $\ell^{2}(A)$ is also a Hilbert space. (See Exercise 19 for other identities of this type.) Note that the sums in (iii) and (iv) are $\|\hat{x}\|_{2}^{2}$ and $(\hat{x}, \hat{y})$, respectively.

Finally, if (i) is false, there exists $u \neq 0$ in $H$ so that $\left(u, u_{\alpha}\right)=0$ for all $\alpha \in A$. If $x=y=u$, then $(x, y)=\|u\|^{2}>0$ but $\hat{x}(\alpha)=0$ for all $\alpha \in A$, hence (iv) fails. Thus (iv) implies (i), and the proof is complete."
16.5,"Suppose $\lambda, p_{k}$, and $q_{k}$ are positive integers,

If $s_{p}(z)$ is the pth partial sum of (2), and if $\beta$ is a regular point of $f$ on $T$, then the sequence $\left\{s_{p_{k}}(z)\right\}$ converges in some neighborhood of $\beta$.","If $g(z)=f(\beta z)$, then $g$ also satisfies the gap condition. Hence we may assume, without loss of generality, that $\beta=1$. Then $f$ has a holomorphic extension to a region $\Omega$ which contains $U \cup\{1\}$. Put

$$
\varphi(w)=\frac{1}{2}\left(w^{\lambda}+w^{\lambda+1}\right)
$$

and define $F(w)=f(\varphi(w))$ for all $w$ such that $\varphi(w) \in \Omega$. If $|w| \leq 1$ but $w \neq 1$, then $|\varphi(w)|<1$, since $|1+w|<2$. Also, $\varphi(1)=1$. It follows that there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that $\varphi(D(0 ; 1+\epsilon)) \subset \Omega$. Note that the region $\varphi(D(0 ; 1+\epsilon))$ contains the point 1 . The series

$$
F(w)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} b_{m} w^{m}
$$

converges if $|w|<1+\epsilon$.

The highest and lowest powers of $w$ in $[\varphi(w)]^{n}$ have exponents $(\lambda+1) n$ and $\lambda n$. Hence the highest exponent in $[\varphi(w)]^{p k}$ is less than the lowest exponent in $[\varphi(w)]^{q_{k}}$, by (1). Since

$$
F(w)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}[\varphi(w)]^{n} \quad(|w|<1)
$$

the gap condition satisfied by $\left\{a_{n}\right\}$ now implies that

$$
\sum_{n=0}^{p_{k}} a_{n}[\varphi(w)]^{n}=\sum_{m=0}^{(\lambda+1) p_{k}} b_{m} w^{m} \quad(k=1,2,3, \ldots)

The right side of (6) converges, as $k \rightarrow \infty$, whenever $|w|<1+\epsilon$. Hence $\left\{s_{p_{k}}(z)\right\}$ converges for all $z \epsilon \varphi(D(0 ; 1+\epsilon))$. This is the desired conclusion. ////

Note: Actually, $\left\{s_{p_{k}}(z)\right\}$ converges uniformly in some neighborhood of $\beta$. We leave it to the reader to verify this by a more careful examination of the preceding proof."
14.13,"If $F \in H(U-\{0\}), F$ is one-to-one in $U$, and

then

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n\left|\alpha_{n}\right|^{2} \leq 1
$$","The choice of $\alpha_{0}$ is clearly irrelevant. So assume $\alpha_{0}=0$. Neither the hypothesis nor the conclusion is affected if we replace $F(z)$ by $\lambda F(\lambda z)$ $(|\lambda|=1)$. So we may assume that $\alpha_{1}$ is real.

Put $U_{r}=\{z:|z|<r\}, C_{r}=\{z:|z|=r\}$, and $V_{r}=\{z: r<|z|<1\}$, for $0<r<1$. Then $F\left(U_{r}\right)$ is a neighborhood of $\infty$ (by the open mapping theorem, applied to $1 / F)$; the sets $F\left(U_{r}\right), F\left(C_{r}\right)$, and $F\left(V_{r}\right)$ are disjoint, since $F$ is one-to-one. Write

$$
F(z)=\frac{1}{z}+\alpha_{1} z+\varphi(z) \quad(z \in U)
$$

$F=u+i v$, and

$$
A=\frac{1}{r}+\alpha_{1} r, \quad B=\frac{1}{r}-\alpha_{1} r .
$$

For $z=r e^{i \theta}$, we then obtain

$$
u=A \cos \theta+\operatorname{Re} \varphi \quad \text { and } \quad v=-B \sin \theta+\operatorname{Im} \varphi
$$

Divide Eqs. (5) by $A$ and $B$, respectively, square, and add:

$$
\frac{u^{2}}{A^{2}}+\frac{v^{2}}{B^{2}}=1+\frac{2 \cos \theta}{A} \operatorname{Re} \varphi+\left(\frac{\operatorname{Re} \varphi}{A}\right)^{2}-\frac{2 \sin \theta}{B} \operatorname{Im} \varphi+\left(\frac{\operatorname{Im} \varphi}{B}\right)^{2}
$$

By (3), $\varphi$ has a zero of order at least 2 at the origin. If we keep account of (4), it follows that there exists an $\eta>0$ such that, for all sufficiently small $r$,

$$
\frac{u^{2}}{A^{2}}+\frac{v^{2}}{B^{2}}<1+\eta r^{3} \quad\left(z=r e^{i \theta}\right)
$$

This says that $F\left(C_{r}\right)$ is in the interior of the ellipse $E_{r}$ whose semiaxes are $A \sqrt{1+\eta r^{3}}$ and $B \sqrt{1+\eta r^{3}$, and which therefore bounds an area

$$
\pi A B\left(1+\eta r^{3}\right)=\pi\left(\frac{1}{r}+\alpha_{1} r\right)\left(\frac{1}{r}-\alpha_{1} r\right)\left(1+\eta r^{3}\right) \leq \frac{\pi}{r^{2}}\left(1+\eta r^{3}\right)
$$

Since $F\left(C_{r}\right)$ is in the interior of $E_{r}$, we have $E_{r} \subset F\left(U_{r}\right)$; hence $F\left(V_{r}\right)$ is in the interior of $E_{r}$, so the area of $F\left(V_{r}\right)$ is no larger than (7). The CauchyRiemann equations show that the Jacobian of the mapping $(x, y) \rightarrow(u, v)$ is $\left|F^{\prime}\right|^{2}$. Theorem 7.26 therefore gives the following result:

$$
\frac{\pi}{r^{2}}\left(1+\eta r^{3}\right) \geq \iint_{V_{r}}\left|F^{\prime}\right|^{2}
$$

$$
=\int_{r}^{1} t d t \int_{0}^{2 \pi}\left|-t^{-2} e^{-2 i \theta}+\sum_{1}^{\infty} n \alpha_{n} t^{n-1} e^{i(n-1) \theta}\right|^{2} d \theta
$$

$$
=2 \pi \int_{r}^{1}\left(t^{-3}+\sum_{1}^{\infty} n^{2}\left|\alpha_{n}\right|^{2} t^{2 n-1}\right) d t
$$

$$
=\pi\left\{r^{-2}-1+\sum_{1}^{\infty} n\left|\alpha_{n}\right|^{2}\left(1-r^{2 n}\right)\right\}
$$

If we divide (8) by $\pi$ and then subtract $r^{-2}$ from each side, we obtain

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{N} n\left|\alpha_{n}\right|^{2}\left(1-r^{2 n}\right) \leq 1+\eta r

for all sufficiently small $r$ and for all positive integers $N$. Let $r \rightarrow 0$ in (9), then let $N \rightarrow \infty$. This gives (2)."

It follows from Theorems 16.13 and 16.14 that the analytic continuations of $(f, D)$ along $\Gamma_{0}$ and $\Gamma_{1}$ lead to the same element $\left(g_{\beta}, D_{\beta}\right)$, where $D_{\beta}$ is a disc with center at $\beta$. If $D_{\beta_{1}}$ intersects $D_{\beta}$, then $\left(g_{\beta_{1}}, D_{\beta_{1}}\right)$ can be obtained by first continuing $(f, D)$ to $\beta$, then along the straight line from $\beta$ to $\beta_{1}$.

The definition

Since $L^{2}(T) \subset L^{1}(T)$, (1) can be applied to every $f \in L^{2}(T)$. Comparing the definitions made in Secs. 4.23 and 4.13, we can now restate Theorems 4.17 and 4.18 in concrete terms:

The Riesz-Fischer theorem asserts that if $\left\{c_{n}\right\}$ is a sequence of complex numbers such that

$$
\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\left|c_{n}\right|^{2}<\infty
$$

then there exists an $f \in L^{2}(T)$ such that

$$
c_{n}=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(t) e^{-i n t} d t \quad(n \in Z)

$$
\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(n) \overline{\hat{g}(n)}=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(t) \overline{g(t)} d t
$$

whenever $f \in L^{2}(T)$ and $g \in L^{2}(T)$; the series on the left of (6) converges absolutely; and if $s_{N}$ is as in (3), then

$$
\lim _{N \rightarrow \infty}\left\|f-s_{N}\right\|_{2}=0
$$

since a special case of (6) yields

$$
\left\|f-s_{N}\right\|_{2}^{2}=\sum_{|n|>N}|\hat{f}(n)|^{2}
$$

Note that (7) says that every $f \in L^{2}(T)$ is the $L^{2}$-limit of the partial sums of its Fourier series; i.e., the Fourier series of $f$ converges to $f$, in the $L^{2}$-sense. Pointwise convergence presents a more delicate problem, as we shall see in Chap. 5.

The Riesz-Fischer theorem and the Parseval theorem may be summarized by saying that the mapping $f \leftrightarrow \hat{f}$ is a Hilbert space isomorphism of $L^{2}(T)$ onto $\ell^{2}(Z)$.

The theory of Fourier series in other function spaces, for instance in $L^{1}(T)$, is much more difficult than in $L^{2}(T)$, and we shall touch only a few aspects of it.

Observe that the crucial ingredient in the proof of the Riesz-Fischer theorem is the fact that $L^{2}$ is complete. This is so well recognized that the name ""RieszFischer theorem"" is sometimes given to the theorem which asserts the completeness of $L^{2}$, or even of any $L^{p}$.",

If $\lambda \in D(\varphi(a) ; c)$, then $|\lambda-\varphi(a)|<c$, hence (3) implies

$$
\min _{\theta}\left|\lambda-\varphi\left(a+r e^{i \theta}\right)\right|>c .
$$

By the corollary to Theorem 10.24, $\lambda-\varphi$ must therefore have a zero in $D(a ; r)$. Thus $\lambda=\varphi(z)$ for some $z \in D(a ; r) \subset V$.

This proves that $D(\varphi(a) ; c) \subset \varphi(V)$. Since $a$ was an arbitrary point of $V$, $\varphi(V)$ is open.

To prove (c), fix $w_{1} \in W$. Then $\varphi\left(z_{1}\right)=w_{1}$ for a unique $z_{1} \in V$. If $w \in W$ and $\psi(w)=z \in V$, we have

$$
\frac{\psi(w)-\psi\left(w_{1}\right)}{w-w_{1}}=\frac{z-z_{1}}{\varphi(z)-\varphi\left(z_{1}\right)}
$$

By (1), $z \rightarrow z_{1}$ when $w \rightarrow w_{1}$. Hence (2) implies that $\psi^{\prime}\left(w_{1}\right)=1 / \varphi^{\prime}\left(z_{1}\right)$. Thus $\psi \in H(W)$."

$$","Let $B$ be the closure in $C=C(T)$ of the set of all functions of the form

$$
\sum_{n=0}^{N} P_{n} g^{n}
$$

The theorem asserts that $B=C$. Let us assume $B \neq C$.

The set of all functions (3) (note that $N$ is not fixed) is a complex algebra. Its closure $B$ is a Banach algebra which contains the function $f_{0}$, where $f_{0}\left(e^{i \theta}\right)=e^{i \theta}$. Our assumption that $B \neq C$ implies that $1 / f_{0} \notin B$, for otherwise $B$ would contain $f_{0}^{n}$ for all integers $n$, hence all trigonometric polynomials would be in $B$; and since the trigonometric polynomials are dense in $C$ (Theorem 4.25) we should have $B=C$.

So $f_{0}$ is not invertible in $B$. By Theorem 18.17 there is a complex homomorphism $h$ of $B$ such that $h\left(f_{0}\right)=0$. Every homomorphism onto the complex field satisfies $h(1)=1$; and since $h\left(f_{0}\right)=0$, we also have

$$
h\left(f_{0}^{n}\right)=\left[h\left(f_{0}\right)\right]^{n}=0 \quad(n=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

We know that $h$ is a linear functional on $B$, of norm at most 1 . The Hahn-Banach theorem extends $h$ to a linear functional on $C$ (still denoted by $h)$ of the same norm. Since $h(1)=1$ and $\|h\| \leq 1$, the argument used in Sec. 5.22 shows that $h$ is a positive linear functional on $C. In particular, $h(f)$ is real for real $f; hence $h(\bar{f})=\bar{h}(f)$. Since $f_{0}^{-n}$ is the complex conjugate of $f_{0}^{n}$, it follows that (4) also holds for $n=-1,-2,-3, \ldots$ Thus

$$
h\left(f_{0}^{n}\right)= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } n=0 \\ 0 & \text { if } n \neq 0\end{cases}
$$

Since the trigonometric polynomials are dense in $C$, there is only one bounded linear functional on $C$ which satisfies (5). Hence $h$ is given by the formula

$$
h(f)=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f\left(e^{i \theta}\right) d \theta \quad(f \in C)
$$

Now if $n$ is a positive integer, $g f_{0}^{n} \in B$; and since $h$ is multiplicative on $B$, (6) gives

$$
\hat{g}(-n)=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} g\left(e^{i \theta}\right) e^{i n \theta} d \theta=h\left(g f_{0}^{n}\right)=h(g) h\left(f_{0}^{n}\right)=0,
$$

by (5). This contradicts the hypothesis of the theorem.

We conclude with a theorem due to Wiener."

10.13,"Cauchy's Theorem for a Triangle Suppose $\Delta$ is a closed triangle in a plane open set $\Omega, p \in \Omega, f$ is continuous on $\Omega$, and $f \in H(\Omega-\{p\})$. Then

$$
\int_{\partial \Delta} f(z) d z=0
$$","We assume first that $p \notin \Delta$. Let $a, b$, and $c$ be the vertices of $\Delta$, let $a^{
prime}$, $b^{
prime}$, and $c^{
prime}$ be the midpoints of $[b, c],[c, a]$, and $[a, b]$, respectively, and consider the four triangles $\Delta^{j}$ formed by the ordered triples

$$

prime}, c^{
prime}\right\}, \quad\left\{c, b^{
prime}, a^{
prime}\right\}, \quad\left\{a^{
prime}, b^{
prime}, c^{

$$

If $J$ is the value of the integral (1), it follows from 10.9(6) that

$$
J=\sum_{j=1}^{4} \int_{\partial \Delta^{
prime}} f(z) d z
$$

The absolute value of at least one of the integrals on the right of (3) is therefore at least $|J / 4|$. Call the corresponding triangle $\Delta_{1}$, repeat the argument with $\Delta_{1}$ in place of $\Delta$, and so forth. This generates a sequence of triangles $\Delta_{n}$
such that $\Delta \supset \Delta_{1} \supset \Delta_{2} \supset \cdots$, such that the length of $\partial \Delta_{n}$ is $2^{-n} L$, if $L$ is the length of $\partial \Delta$, and such that

$$
|J| \leq 4^{n}\left|\int_{\partial \Delta_{n}} f(z) d z\right| \quad(n=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

There is a (unique) point $z_{0}$ which the triangles $\Delta_{n}$ have in common. Since $\Delta$ is compact, $z_{0} \in \Delta$, so $f$ is differentiable at $z_{0$].

Let $\epsilon>0$ be given. There exists an $r>0$ such that

$$
\left|f(z)-f\left(z_{0}\right)-f^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right)\left(z-z_{0}\right)\right| \leq \epsilon\left|z-z_{0}\right|
$$

whenever $\left|z-z_{0}\right|<r$, and there exists an $n$ such that $\left|z-z_{0}\right|<r$ for all $z \in \Delta_{n}$. For this $n$ we also have $\left|z-z_{0}\right| \leq 2^{-n} L$ for all $z \in \Delta_{n}$. By the Corollary to Theorem 10.12,

$$
\int_{\partial \Delta_{n}} f(z) d z=\int_{\partial \Delta_{n}}\left[f(z)-f\left(z_{0}\right)-f^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right)\left(z-z_{0}\right)\right] d z,
$$

so that (5) implies

$$
\left|\int_{\partial \Delta_{n}} f(z) d z\right| \leq \epsilon\left(2^{-n} L\right)^{2}
$$

and now (4) shows that $|J| \leq \epsilon L^{2}$. Hence $J=0$ if $p \notin \Delta$.

Assume next that $p$ is a vertex of $\Delta$, say $p=a$. If $a, b$, and $c$ are collinear, then (1) is trivial, for any continuous $f$. If not, choose points $x \in[a, b]$ and $y \in[a, c]$, both close to $a$, and observe that the integral of $f$ over $\partial \Delta$ is the sum of the integrals over the boundaries of the triangles $\{a, x, y\},\{x, b, y\}$, and $\{b, c, y\}$. The last two of these are 0 , since these triangles do not contain $p$. Hence the integral over $\partial \Delta$ is the sum of the integrals over $[a, x],[x, y]$, and $[y, a]$, and since these intervals can be made arbitrarily short and $f$ is bounded on $\Delta$, we again obtain (1).

Finally, if $p$ is an arbitrary point of $\Delta$, apply the preceding result to $\{a, b, p\},\{b, c, p\}$, and $\{c, a, p\}$ to complete the proof."
10.14,"Cauchy's Theorem in a Convex Set Suppose $\Omega$ is a convex open set, $p \in \Omega, f$ is continuous on $\Omega$, and $f \in H(\Omega-\{p\})$. Then $f=F^{\prime}$ for some $F \in H(\Omega)$. Hence

$$

For any $z$ and $z_{0} \in \Omega$, the triangle with vertices at $a, z_{0}$, and $z$ lies in $\Omega$; hence $F(z)-F\left(z_{0}\right)$ is the integral of $f$ over $\left[z_{0}, z\right]$, by Theorem 10.13. Fixing $z_{0}$, we thus obtain

$$
\frac{F(z)-F\left(z_{0}\right)}{z-z_{0}}-f\left(z_{0}\right)=\frac{1}{z-z_{0}} \int_{\left[z_{0}, z\right]}\left[f(\xi)-f\left(z_{0}\right)\right] d \xi

if $z \neq z_{0}$. Given $\epsilon>0$, the continuity of $f$ at $z_{0}$ shows that there is a $\delta>0$ such that $\left|f(\xi)-f\left(z_{0}\right)\right|<\epsilon$ if $\left|\xi-z_{0}\right|<\delta$; hence the absolute value of the left side of (3) is less than $\epsilon$ as soon as $\left|z-z_{0}\right|<\delta$. This proves that $f=F^{\prime}$. In particular, $F \in H(\Omega)$. Now (1) follows from Theorem 10.12."

$$
\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{\gamma} g(\xi) d \xi=0

10.21,"If $a \in \Omega$ and $f \in H(\Omega-\{a\})$, then one of the following three cases must occur:

$$
f(z)-\sum_{k=1}^{m} \frac{c_{k}}{(z-a)^{k}}

(c) If $r>0$ and $D(a ; r) \subset \Omega$, then $f\left(D^{\prime}(a ; r)\right)$ is dense in the plane.

In case $(b), f$ is said to have a pole of order $m$ at $a$. The function

\sum_{k=1}^{m} c_{k}(z-a)^{-k}

a polynomial in $(z-a)^{-1}$, is called the principal part of $f$ at $a$. It is clear in this situation that $|f(z)| \rightarrow \infty$ as $z \rightarrow a$.

In case $(c), f$ is said to have an essential singularity at $a$. A statement equivalent to $(c)$ is that to each complex number $w$ there corresponds a sequence $\left\{z_{n}\right\}$ such that $z_{n} \rightarrow a$ and $f\left(z_{n}\right) \rightarrow w$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.","Suppose (c) fails.

Then $g \in H\left(D^{\prime}\right)$ and $|g|<1 / \delta$. By Theorem 10.20, $g$ extends to a holomorphic function in $D$.

If $g(a) \neq 0,(1)$ shows that $f$ is bounded in $D^{\prime}(a ; \rho)$ for some $\rho>0$. Hence (a) holds, by Theorem 10.20 .

g(z)=(z-a)^{m} g_{1}(z) \quad(z \in D)

$$
\left(Q_{r} \mu\right)(x)=\frac{\mu(B(x, r))}{m(B(x, r))}

$$
(M \mu)(x)=\sup _{0<r<\infty}\left(Q_{r} \mu\right)(x)
$$

and the maximal function of a complex Borel measure $\mu$ is, by definition, that of its total variation $|\mu|$.

The functions $M \mu: R^{k} \rightarrow[0, \infty]$ are lower semicontinuous, hence measurable.

This says that the real part of $\alpha f$ is equal to $|\alpha f|$ a.e., hence $\alpha f=|\alpha f|=|f|$ a.e., which is the desired conclusion."

To prove the existence of the decomposition, note that the set

To prove that $Q$ maps $H$ into $M^{\perp}$ we show that $(Q x, y)=0$ for all $y \in M$. Assume $\|y\|=1$, without loss of generality, and put $z=Q x$. The minimizing property of $Q x$ shows that

$$
(z, z)=\|z\|^{2} \leq\|z-\alpha y\|^{2}=(z-\alpha y, z-\alpha y)

Put $A_{1}=A \cap K_{1}$, and $A_{n}=A \cap\left(K_{n}-K_{n-1}\right)$ for $n=2,3,4, \ldots$ Since $A_{n} \subset K_{n}$ and $A$ has no limit point in $\Omega$ (hence none in $K_{n}$ ), each $A_{n}$ is a finite set. Put

$$
Q_{n}(z)=\sum_{\alpha \in A_{n}} P_{\alpha}(z) \quad(n=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

Since each $A_{n}$ is finite, each $Q_{n}$ is a rational function. The poles of $Q_{n}$ lie in $K_{n}-K_{n-1}$, for $n \geq 2$. In particular, $Q_{n}$ is holomorphic in an open set containing $K_{n-1}$. It now follows from Theorem 13.6 that there exist rational functions $R_{n}$, all of whose poles are in $S^{2}-\Omega$, such that

$$
\left|R_{n}(z)-Q_{n}(z)\right|<2^{-n} \quad\left(z \in K_{n-1}\right)

$$
f=Q_{1}+\sum_{n=2}^{N}\left(Q_{n}-R_{n}\right)+\sum_{N+1}^{\infty}\left(Q_{n}-R_{n}\right)

By (2), each term in the last sum in (4) is less than $2^{-n}$ on $K_{N}$; hence this last series converges uniformly on $K_{N}$, to a function which is holomorphic in the interior of $K_{N}$. Since the poles of each $R_{n}$ are outside $\Omega$,

$$
f-\left(Q_{1}+\cdots+Q_{N}\right)
$$

is holomorphic in the interior of $K_{N}$. Thus $f$ has precisely the prescribed principal parts in the interior of $K_{N}$, and hence in $\Omega$, since $N$ was arbitrary."
19.3,"Suppose $A$ and $C$ are positive constants and $f$ is an entire function such that

$$
\lim _{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{\epsilon}(x) e^{-i t x} d x=0 \quad(t \text { real, }|t|>A)
$$

Since $\left\|f_{\epsilon}-f\right\|_{2} \rightarrow 0$ as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, the Plancherel theorem implies that the Fourier transforms of $f_{\epsilon}$ converge in $L^{2}$ to the Fourier transform $F$ of $f$ (more precisely, of the restriction of $f$ to the real axis). Hence (4) will imply that $F$ vanishes outside $[-A, A]$, and then Theorem 9.14 shows that (3) holds for almost every real $z$. Since each side of (3) is an entire function, it follows that (3) holds for every complex $z$.

Thus (4) implies the theorem.

For each real $\alpha$, let $\Gamma_{\alpha}$ be the path defined by

$$
\Gamma_{\alpha}(s)=s e^{i \alpha} \quad(0 \leq s<\infty)
$$

put

$$
\Pi_{\alpha}=\left\{w: \operatorname{Re}\left(w e^{i \alpha}\right)>A\right\},
$$

and if $w \in \Pi_{\alpha}$, define

$$
\Phi_{\alpha}(w)=\int_{\Gamma_{\alpha}} f(z) e^{-w z} d z=e^{i \alpha} \int_{0}^{\infty} f\left(s e^{i \alpha}\right) \exp \left(-w s e^{i \alpha}\right) d s
$$

By (1) and (5), the absolute value of the integrand is at most

$$
C \exp \left\{-\left[\operatorname{Re}\left(w e^{i \alpha}\right)-A\right] s\right\},
$$

and it follows (as in Sec. 19.1) that $\Phi_{\alpha}$ is holomorphic in the half plane $\Pi_{\alpha}$.

However, more is true if $\alpha=0$ and if $\alpha=\pi$ : We have

$$
\Phi_{0}(w)=\int_{0}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-w x} d x \quad(\operatorname{Re} w>0)
$$

$$
\Phi_{\pi}(w)=-\int_{-\infty}^{0} f(x) e^{-w x} d x \quad(\operatorname{Re} w<0)
$$

$\Phi_{0}$ and $\Phi_{\pi}$ are holomorphic in the indicated half planes because of (2).

The significance of the functions $\Phi_{\alpha}$ to (4) lies in the easily verified relation

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{\epsilon}(x) e^{-i t x} d x=\Phi_{0}(\epsilon+i t)-\Phi_{\pi}(-\epsilon+i t) \quad(t \text { real })
$$

Hence we have to prove that the right side of (10) tends to 0 as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, if $t>A$ and if $t<-A$.

We shall do this by showing that any two of our functions $\Phi_{\alpha}$ agree in the intersection of their domains of definition, i.e., that they are analytic continuations of each other. Once this is done, we can replace $\Phi_{0}$ and $\Phi_{\pi}$ by $\Phi_{\pi / 2}$ in (10) if $t<-A$, and by $\Phi_{-\pi / 2}$ if $t>A$, and it is then obvious that the difference tends to 0 as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$.

So suppose $0<\beta-\alpha<\pi$. Put

$$
\gamma=\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}, \quad \eta=\cos \frac{\beta-\alpha}{2}>0
$$

If $w=|w| e^{-i \gamma}$, then

$$
\operatorname{Re}\left(w e^{i \alpha}\right)=\eta|w|=\operatorname{Re}\left(w e^{i \beta}\right)
$$

so that $w \in \Pi_{\alpha} \cap \Pi_{\beta}$ as soon as $|w|>A / \eta$. Consider the integral

$$
\int_{\Gamma} f(z) e^{-w z} d z
$$

over the circular arc $\Gamma$ given by $\Gamma(t)=r e^{i t}, \alpha \leq t \leq \beta$. Since

$$
\operatorname{Re}(-w z)=-|w| r \cos (t-\gamma) \leq-|w| r \eta
$$

the absolute value of the integrand in (13) does not exceed

$$
C \exp \{(A-|w| \eta) r\}
$$

If $|w|>A / \eta$ it follows that (13) tends to 0 as $r \rightarrow \infty$.

We now apply the Cauchy theorem. The integral of $f(z) e^{-w z}$ over the interval $\left[0, r e^{i \beta}\right]$ is equal to the sum of $(13)$ and the integral over $\left[0, r e^{i x}\right]$. Since (13) tends to 0 as $r \rightarrow \infty$, we conclude that $\Phi_{\alpha}(w)=\Phi_{\beta}(w)$ if $w=|w| e^{-i \gamma}$ and $|w|>A / \eta$, and then Theorem 10.18 shows that $\Phi_{\alpha}$ and $\Phi_{\beta}$ coincide in the intersection of the half planes in which they were originally defined.

This completes the proof."

$$
\Omega=\{x+i y: a<x<b\}, \quad \bar{\Omega}=\{x+i y: a \leq x \leq b\}

$f$ is continuous on $\bar{\Omega}, f \in H(\Omega)$, and suppose that $|f(z)|<B$ for all $z \in \Omega$ and some fixed $B<\infty$. If

$$
M(x)=\sup \{|f(x+i y)|:-\infty<y<\infty\} \quad(a \leq x \leq b)
$$

then we actually have

$$
M(x)^{b-a} \leq M(a)^{b-x} M(b)^{x-a} \quad(a<x<b)
$$

","We assume first that $M(a)=M(b)=1$. In this case we have to prove that $|f(z)| \leq 1$ for all $z \in \Omega$.

For each $\epsilon>0$, we define an auxiliary function

$$
h_{\epsilon}(z)=\frac{1}{1+\epsilon(z-a)} \quad(z \in \bar{\Omega})
$$

Since $\operatorname{Re}\{1+\epsilon(z-a)\}=1+\epsilon(x-a) \geq 1$ in $\bar{\Omega}$, we have $\left|h_{\epsilon}\right| \leq 1$ in $\bar{\Omega}$, so that

$$
\left|f(z) h_{\epsilon}(z)\right| \leq 1 \quad(z \in \partial \Omega)
$$

Also, $|1+\epsilon(z-a)| \geq \epsilon|y|$, so that

$$
\left|f(z) h_{\epsilon}(z)\right| \leq \frac{B}{\epsilon|y|} \quad(z=x+i y \in \bar{\Omega})
$$

Let $R$ be the rectangle cut off from $\bar{\Omega}$ by the lines $y= \pm B / \epsilon$. By (5) and (6), $\left|f h_{\epsilon}\right| \leq 1$ on $\partial R$, hence $\left|f h_{\epsilon}\right| \leq 1$ on $R$, by the maximum modulus theorem. But (6) shows that $\left|f h_{\epsilon}\right| \leq 1$ on the rest of $\bar{\Omega}$. Thus $\left|f(z) h_{\epsilon}(z)\right| \leq 1$
for all $z \in \Omega$ and all $\epsilon>0$. If we fix $z \in \Omega$ and then let $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, we obtain the desired result $|f(z)| \leq 1$.

We now turn to the general case. Put

$$
g(z)=M(a)^{(b-z) /(b-a)} M(b)^{(z-a) /(b-a)}
$$

where, for $M>0$ and $w$ complex, $M^{w}$ is defined by

$$
M^{w}=\exp (w \log M)
$$

and $\log M$ is real. Then $g$ is entire, $g$ has no zero, $1 / g$ is bounded in $\bar{\Omega}$,

$$
|g(a+i y)|=M(a), \quad|g(b+i y)|=M(b)
$$

and hence $f / g$ satisfies our previous assumptions. Thus $|f / g| \leq 1$ in $\Omega$, and this gives (3). (See Exercise 7.)"
7.18 (a),"Let $I=[a, b]$, let $f: I \rightarrow R^{1}$ be continuous and nondecreasing. Then $f$ is $\mathrm{AC}$ on $I$","We will show that $(a) \rightarrow(b) \rightarrow(c) \rightarrow(a)$. Assume $f$ is $\mathrm{AC}$ on $I$, pick $E \subset I$ so that $E \in \mathfrak{M}$ and $m(E)=0$. We have to show that $f(E) \in \mathfrak{M}$ and $m(f(E))=0$. Without loss of generality, assume that neither $a$ nor $b$ lie in $E$. Choose $\epsilon>0$. Associate $\delta>0$ to $f$ and $\epsilon$, as in Definition 7.17. There is then an open set $V$ with $m(V)<\delta$, so that $E \subset V \subset I$. Let $(\alpha_{i}, \beta_{i})$ be the disjoint segments whose union is $V$. Then $\sum(\beta_{i}-\alpha_{i})<\delta$, and our choice of $\delta$ shows that therefore $\sum_{i}(f(\beta_{i})-f(\alpha_{i})) \leq \epsilon$ [Definition 7.17 was stated in terms of finite sums; thus (2) holds for every partial sum of the (possibly) infinite series, hence (2) holds also for the sum of the whole series, as stated.] Since $E \subset V, f(E) \subset \bigcup[f(\alpha_{i}), f(\beta_{i})]$. The Lebesgue measure of this union is the left side of (2). This says that $f(E)$ is a subset of Borel sets of arbitrarily small measure. Since Lebesgue measure is complete, it follows that $f(E) \in \mathfrak{M}$ and $m(f(E))=0$."
7.18 (b),"Let $I=[a, b]$, let $f: I \rightarrow R^{1}$ be continuous and nondecreasing. Then $f$ maps sets of measure 0 to sets of measure 0","Assume next that $(b)$ holds. Define $g(x)=x+f(x) \quad(a \leq x \leq b)$ If the $f$-image of some segment of length $\eta$ has length $\eta^{\prime}$, then the $g$-image of that same segment has length $\eta+\eta^{\prime}$. From this it follows easily that $g$ satisfies $(b)$, since $f$ does. Now suppose $E \subset I, E \in \mathfrak{M}$. Then $E=E_{1} \cup E_{0}$ where $m\left(E_{0}\right)=0$ and $E_{1}$ is an $F_{\sigma}$ (Theorem 2.20). Thus $E_{1}$ is a countable union of compact sets, and so is $g\left(E_{1}\right)$, because $g$ is continuous. Since $g$ satisfies $(b), m\left(g\left(E_{0}\right)\right)=0$. Since $g(E)=g\left(E_{1}\right) \cup g\left(E_{0}\right)$, we conclude: $g(E) \in \mathfrak{M}$. Therefore we can define $\mu(E)=m(g(E)) \quad(E \subset I, E \in \mathfrak{M})$ Since $g$ is one-to-one (this is our reason for working with $g$ rather than $f$ ), disjoint sets in $I$ have disjoint $g$-images. The countable additivity of $m$ shows therefore that $\mu$ is a (positive, bounded) measure on $\mathfrak{M}$. Also, $\mu \ll m$, because $g$ satisfies $(b)$. Thus $d \mu=h d m$ for some $h \in L^{1}(m)$, by the Radon-Nikodym theorem. If $E=[a, x]$, then $g(E)=[g(a), g(x)]$, and (5) gives $g(x)-g(a)=m(g(E))=\mu(E)=\int_{E} h d m=\int_{a}^{x} h(t) d t .$ If we now use (3), we conclude that $f(x)-f(a)=\int_{a}^{x}[h(t)-1] d t \quad(\alpha \leq x \leq b)$ Thus $f^{\prime}(x)=h(x)-1$ a.e. $[m]$, by Theorem 7.11."

Write $f_{y}(x)$ for $f(x+i y)$. Then $f_{y} \in L^{2}(-\infty, \infty)$, ty hypothesis, and the Plancherel theorem asserts that

$$
\lim _{j \rightarrow \infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left|\hat{f}_{y}(t)-g_{j}(y, t)\right|^{2} d t=0
$$

where $\hat{f}_{y}$ is the Fourier transform of $f_{y}$. A subsequence of $\left\{g_{j}(y, t)\right\}$ converges therefore pointwise to $\hat{f}_{y}(t)$, for almost all $t$ (Theorem 3.12). If we define

$$
F(t)=e^{t} \hat{f}_{1}(t)
$$

it now follows from (12) that

$$
F(t)=e^{t y} \hat{f}_{y}(t)
$$

Note that (14) does not involve $y$ and that (15) holds for every $y \in(0, \infty)$. Plancherel's theorem can be applied to (15):

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-2 t y}|F(t)|^{2} d t=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left|\hat{f}_{y}(t)\right|^{2} d t=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left|f_{y}(x)\right|^{2} d x \leq C .
$$

If we let $y \rightarrow \infty,(16)$ shows that $F(t)=0$ a.e. in $(-\infty, 0)$.

If we let $y \rightarrow 0,(16)$ shows that

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty}|F(t)|^{2} d t \leq C
$$

It now follows from (15) that $\hat{f}_{y} \in L^{1}$ if $y>0$. Hence Theorem 9.14 gives

$$
f_{y}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}_{y}(t) e^{i t x} d t
$$

or

$$
f(z)=\int_{0}^{\infty} F(t) e^{-y t} e^{i t x} d t=\int_{0}^{\infty} F(t) e^{i t z} d t \quad\left(z \in \Pi^{+}\right) .
$$

This is (2), and now (3) follows from (17) and formula 19.13)."
10.18,"Suppose $\Omega$ is a region, $f \in H(\Omega)$, and

$$
Z(f)=\{a \in \Omega: f(a)=0\}
$$

Then either $Z(f)=\Omega$, or $Z(f)$ has no limit point in $\Omega$. In the latter case there corresponds to each $a \in Z(f) a$ unique positive integer $m=m(a)$ such that

$$
f(z)=(z-a)^{m} g(z) \quad(z \in \Omega)
$$

where $g \in H(\Omega)$ and $g(a) \neq 0$; furthermore, $Z(f)$ is at most countable.","Let $A$ be the set of all limit points of $Z(f)$ in $\Omega$. Since $f$ is continuous, $A \subset Z(f)$.

Fix $a \in Z(f)$, and choose $r>0$ so that $D(a ; r) \subset \Omega$. By Theorem 10.16,

$$
f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{n}(z-a)^{n} \quad(z \in D(a ; r))
$$

There are now two possibilities. Either all $c_{n}$ are 0 , in which case $D(a ; r) \subset A$ and $a$ is an interior point of $A$, or there is a smallest integer $m$ [necessarily positive, since $f(a)=0]$ such that $c_{m} \neq 0$. In that case, define

$$
g(z)= \begin{cases}(z-a)^{-m} f(z) & (z \in \Omega-\{a\}) \\ c_{m} & (z=a)\end{cases}
$$

Then (2) holds. It is clear that $g \in H(\Omega-\{a\})$. But (3) implies

$$
g(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_{m+k}(z-a)^{k} \quad(z \in D(a ; r))
$$

Hence $g \in H(D(a ; r))$, so actually $g \in H(\Omega)$.

Moreover, $g(a) \neq 0$, and the continuity of $g$ shows that there is a neighborhood of $a$ in which $g$ has no zero. Thus $a$ is an isolated point of $Z(f)$, by (2).

If $a \in A$, the first case must therefore occur. So $A$ is open. If $B=\Omega-A$, it is clear from the definition of $A$ as a set of limit points that $B$ is open. Thus $\Omega$ is the union of the disjoint open sets $A$ and $B$. Since $\Omega$ is connected, we have either $A=\Omega$, in which case $Z(f)=\Omega$, or $A=\varnothing$. In the latter case, $Z(f)$ has at most finitely many points in each compact subset of $\Omega$, and since $\Omega$ is $\sigma$-compact, $Z(f)$ is at most countable."
8.3,$\mathscr{S} \times \mathscr{T}$ is the smallest monotone class which contains all elementary sets.,"Let $\mathfrak{M}$ be the smallest monotone class which contains $\mathscr{E}$; the proof that this class exists is exactly like that of Theorem 1.10. Since $\mathscr{S} \times \mathscr{T}$ is a monotone class, we have $\mathfrak{M} \subset \mathscr{S} \times \mathscr{T}$.

The identities

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left(A_{1} \times B_{1}\right) \cap\left(A_{2} \times B_{2}\right)=\left(A_{1} \cap A_{2}\right) \times\left(B_{1} \cap B_{2}\right) \\
& \left(A_{1} \times B_{1}\right)-\left(A_{2} \times B_{2}\right)=\left[\left(A_{1}-A_{2}\right) \times B_{1}\right] \cup\left[\left(A_{1} \cap A_{2}\right) \times\left(B_{1}-B_{2}\right)\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

show that the intersection of two measurable rectangles is a measurable rectangle and that their difference is the union of two disjoint measurable rectangles, hence is an elementary set. If $P \in \mathscr{E}$ and $Q \in \mathscr{E}$, it follows easily that $P \cap Q \in \mathscr{E}$ and $P-Q \in \mathscr{E}$. Since

$$
P \cup Q=(P-Q) \cup Q
$$

and $(P-Q) \cap Q=\varnothing$, we also have $P \cup Q \in \mathscr{E}$.

For any set $P \subset X \times Y$, define $\Omega(P)$ to be the class of all $Q \subset X \times Y$ such that $P-Q \in \mathfrak{M}, Q-P \in \mathfrak{M}$, and $P \cup Q \in \mathfrak{M}$. The following properties are obvious:

(a) $Q \in \Omega(P)$ if and only if $P \in \Omega(Q)$.

(b) Since $\mathfrak{M}$ is a monotone class, so is each $\Omega(P)$.

Fix $P \in \mathscr{E}$. Our preceding remarks about $\mathscr{E}$ show that $Q \in \Omega(P)$ for all $Q \in \mathscr{E}$, hence $\mathscr{E} \subset \Omega(P)$, and now $(b)$ implies that $\mathfrak{M} \subset \Omega(P)$.

Next, fix $Q \in \mathfrak{M}$. We just saw that $Q \in \Omega(P)$ if $P \in \mathscr{E}$. By $(a), P \in \Omega(Q)$, hence $\mathscr{E} \subset \Omega(Q)$, and if we refer to $(b)$ once more we obtain $\mathfrak{M} \subset \Omega(Q)$.

Summing up: If $P$ and $Q \in \mathfrak{M}$, then $P-Q \in \mathfrak{M}$ and $P \cup Q \in \mathfrak{M}$.

It now follows that $\mathfrak{M}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra in $X \times Y$ :

(i) $X \times Y \in \mathscr{E}$. Hence $X \times Y \in \mathfrak{M}$.

(ii) If $Q \in \mathfrak{M}$, then $Q^{c} \in \mathfrak{M}$, since the difference of any two members of $\mathfrak{M}$ is in $\mathfrak{M}$.

(iii) If $P_{i} \in \mathfrak{M}$ for $i=1,2,3, \ldots$, and $P=\bigcup P_{i}$, put

$$
Q_{n}=P_{1} \cup \cdots \cup P_{n} .
$$

Since $\mathfrak{M}$ is closed under the formation of finite unions, $Q_{n} \in \mathfrak{M}$.

Since $Q_{n} \subset Q_{n+1}$ and $P=\bigcup Q_{n}$, the monotonicity of $\mathfrak{M}$ shows that $P \in \mathfrak{M}$.

Thus $\mathfrak{M}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, $\mathscr{E} \subset \mathfrak{M} \subset \mathscr{S} \times \mathscr{T}$, and (by definition) $\mathscr{S} \times \mathscr{T}$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra which contains $\mathscr{E}$. Hence $\mathfrak{M}=\mathscr{S} \times \mathscr{T}$."
10.32,"Suppose $\Omega$ is a region, $f \in H(\Omega), f$ is not constant, $z_{0} \in \Omega$, and $w_{0}=f\left(z_{0}\right)$. Let $m$ be the order of the zero which the function $f-w_{0}$ has at $z_{0}$.

Then there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $z_{0}, V \subset \Omega$, and there exists $\varphi \in H(V)$, such that

(a) $f(z)=w_{0}+[\varphi(z)]^{m}$ for all $z \in V$,

(b) $\varphi^{\prime}$ has no zero in $V$ and $\varphi$ is an invertible mapping of $V$ onto a disc $D(0 ; r)$.

Thus $f-w_{0}=\pi_{m} \circ \varphi$ in $V$. It follows that $f$ is an exactly $m$-to-1 mapping of $V-\left\{z_{0}\right\}$ onto $D^{\prime}\left(w_{0} ; r^{m}\right)$, and that each $w_{0} \in f(\Omega)$ is an interior point of $f(\Omega)$. Hence $f(\Omega)$ is open.","Without loss of generality we may assume that $\Omega$ is a convex neighborhood of $z_{0}$ which is so small that $f(z) \neq w_{0}$ if $z \in \Omega-\left\{z_{0}\right\}$. Then

$$
f(z)-w_{0}=\left(z-z_{0}\right)^{m} g(z) \quad(z \in \Omega)
$$

for some $g \in H(\Omega)$ which has no zero in $\Omega$. Hence $g^{\prime} / g \in H(\Omega)$. By Theorem $10.14, g^{\prime} / g=h^{\prime}$ for some $h \in H(\Omega)$. The derivative of $g \cdot \exp (-h)$ is 0 in $\Omega$. If $h$ is modified by the addition of a suitable constant, it follows that $g=\exp (h)$. Define

$$
\varphi(z)=\left(z-z_{0}\right) \exp \frac{h(z)}{m} \quad(z \in \Omega)
$$

Then $(a)$ holds, for all $z \in \Omega$.

Also, $\varphi\left(z_{0}\right)=0$ and $\varphi^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right) \neq 0$. The existence of an open set $V$ that satisfies $(b)$ follows now from Theorem 10.30. This completes the proof."
8.18,If $1<p<\infty$ and $f \in L^{p}\left(R^{k}\right)$ then $M f \in L^{p}\left(R^{k}\right)$,"Since $M f=M(|f|)$ we may assume, without loss of generality, that $f \geq 0$. Theorem 7.4 shows that there is a constant $A$, depending only on the dimension $k$, such that

$$
m\{M g>t\} \leq \frac{A}{t}\|g\|_{1}
$$

for every $g \in L^{1}\left(R^{k}\right)$. Here, and in the rest of this proof, $m=m_{k}$, the Lebesgue measure on $R^{k}$.

Pick a constant $c, 0<c<1$, which will be specified later so as to minimize a certain upper bound. For each $t \in(0, \infty)$, split $f$ into a sum

$$
f=g_{t}+h_{t}
$$

where

$$
g_{t}(x)= \begin{cases}f(x) & \text { if } f(x)>c t \\ 0 & \text { if } f(x) \leq c t .\end{cases}
$$

Then $0 \leq h_{t}(x) \leq c t$ for every $x \in R^{k}$. Hence $h_{t} \in L^{\infty}, M h_{t} \leq c t$, and

$$
M f \leq M g_{t}+M h_{t} \leq M g_{t}+c t
$$

If $(M f)(x)>t$ for some $x$, it follows that

$$
\left(M g_{t}\right)(x)>(1-c) t
$$

Setting $E_{t}=\{f>c t\}$, (5), (1), and (3) imply that

$$
m\{M f>t\} \leq m\left\{M g_{t}>(1-c) t\right\} \leq \frac{A}{(1-c) t}\left\|g_{t}\right\|_{1}=\frac{A}{(1-c) t} \int_{E_{t}} f d m
$$

We now use Theorem 8.16, with $X=R^{k}, \mu=m, \varphi(t)=t^{p}$, to calculate

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{R^{k}}(M f)^{p} d m & =p \int_{0}^{\infty} m\{M f>t\} t^{p-1} d t \leq \frac{A p}{1-c} \int_{0}^{\infty} t^{p-2} d t \int_{E_{t}} f d m \\
& =\frac{A p}{1-c} \int_{R^{k}} f d m \int_{0}^{f / c} t^{p-2} d t=\frac{A p c^{1-p}}{(1-c)(p-1)} \int_{R^{k}} f^{p} d m .
\end{aligned}
$$

This proves the theorem. However, to get a good constant, let us choose $c$ so as to minimize that last expression. This happens when $c=(p-1) / p=1 / q$, where $q$ is the exponent conjugate to $p$. For this $c$,

$$
c^{1-p}=\left(1+\frac{1}{p-1}\right)^{p-1}<e
$$

and the preceding computation yields

$$
\|M f\|_{p} \leq C_{p}\|f\|_{p}
$$

where $C_{p}=(\text { Aepq })^{1 / p}$.

Note that $C_{p} \rightarrow 1$ as $p \rightarrow \infty$, which agrees with formula 8.17(1), and that $C_{p} \rightarrow \infty$ as $p \rightarrow 1$."

By Definition 8.7, (2) is then exactly the conclusion of Theorem 8.6. Hence $(a)$ holds for all nonnegative simple $(\mathscr{S} \times \mathscr{T})$-measurable functions $s$. In the general case, there is a sequence of such functions $s_{n}$, such that $0 \leq s_{1} \leq s_{2} \leq \cdots$ and $s_{n}(x, y) \rightarrow$ $f(x, y)$ at every point of $X \times Y$.

$$

Since $f \in L^{1}(\mu \times \lambda)$ and
$f^{+} \leq|f|$, and since $(a)$ holds for $f^{+}$, we see that $\varphi_{1} \in L^{1}(\mu)$. Similarly, $\varphi_{2} \in$
$L^{1}(\mu)$. Since

we have $f_{x} \in L^{1}(\lambda)$ for every $x$ for which $\varphi_{1}(x)<\infty$ and $\varphi_{2}(x)<\infty$; since $\varphi_{1}$ and $\varphi_{2}$ are in $L^{1}(\mu)$, this happens for almost all $x$; and at any such $x$, we have $\varphi(x)=\varphi_{1}(x)-\varphi_{2}(x)$. Hence $\varphi \in L^{1}(\mu)$. Now (2) holds with $\varphi_{1}$ and $f^{+}$and with $\varphi_{2}$ and $f^{-}$, in place of $\varphi$ and $f$; if we subtract the resulting equations, we obtain one half of $(c)$.

By that theorem, $x \rightarrow f_{-x}$ is a continuous mapping of $R^{1}$ into $L^{2}$, and the continuity of the inner product (Theorem 4.6) therefore implies that $g$ is a continuous function. The Schwarz inequality shows that

$$
|g(x)| \leq\left\|f_{-x}\right\|_{2}\|f\|_{2}=\|f\|_{2}^{2}

so that $g$ is bounded. Also, $g \in L^{1}$ since $f \in L^{1}$ and $\tilde{f} \in L^{1}$.

(b) If $Q_{1} \subset Q_{2} \subset Q_{3} \subset \cdots$, if each $Q_{i} \in \Omega$, and if $Q=\bigcup Q_{i}$, then $Q \in \Omega$.

(c) If $\left\{Q_{i}\right\}$ is a disjoint countable collection of members of $\Omega$, and if $Q=\bigcup Q_{i}$, then $Q \in \Omega$.

(d) If $\mu(A)<\infty$ and $\lambda(B)<\infty$, if $A \times B \supset Q_{1} \supset Q_{2} \supset Q_{3} \supset \cdots$, if $Q=\bigcap Q_{i}$ and $Q_{i} \in \Omega$ for $i=1,2,3, \ldots$, then $Q \in \Omega$.

To prove $(b)$, let $\varphi_{i}$ and $\psi_{i}$ be associated with $Q_{i}$ in the way in which (1) associates $\varphi$ and $\psi$ with $Q$. The countable additivity of $\mu$ and $\lambda$ shows that

the convergence being monotone increasing at every point. Since $\varphi_{i}$ and $\psi_{i}$ are assumed to satisfy the conclusion of the theorem, $(b)$ follows from the monotone convergence theorem.

For finite unions of disjoint sets, $(c)$ is clear, because the characteristic function of a union of disjoint sets is the sum of their characteristic functions. The general case of $(c)$ now follows from $(b)$.

The proof of $(d)$ is like that of $(b)$, except that we use the dominated convergence theorem in place of the monotone convergence theorem. This is legitimate, since $\mu(A)<\infty$ and $\lambda(B)<\infty$.

Thus $Q_{m n} \in \Omega$ for every $Q \in \mathscr{S} \times \mathscr{T}$ and for all choices of $m$ and $n$. Since $Q$ is the union of the sets $Q_{m n}$ and since these sets are disjoint, we conclude from (c) that $Q \in \Omega$. This completes the proof."

Now let $E$ be a Borel set in $X$, and choose $\epsilon>0$. Since $\mu$ satisfies Theorem 2.17, there is a closed set $F$ and an open set $V$ such that $F \subset E \subset V$ and $\mu(V-F)<\epsilon$. Hence $\mu(V) \leq \mu(F)+\epsilon \leq \mu(E)+\epsilon$.

Since $V-F$ is open, (2) shows that $\lambda(V-F)<\epsilon$, hence $\lambda(V) \leq \lambda(E)+\epsilon$. Consequently

and

$$
\lambda(E) \leq \lambda(V)=\mu(V) \leq \mu(E)+\epsilon
$$

$$
\mu(E) \leq \mu(V)=\lambda(V) \leq \lambda(E)+\epsilon,
$$

so that $|\lambda(E)-\mu(E)|<\epsilon$ for every $\epsilon>0$. Hence $\lambda(E)=\mu(E)$."
18.9,"For every $x \in A$:

$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left\|x^{n}\right\|^{1 / n}=\rho(x)
$$

(This existence of the limit is part of the conclusion.)","Fix $x \in A$, let $n$ be a positive integer, $\lambda$ a complex number, and assume $\lambda^{n} \notin \sigma\left(x^{n}\right)$. We have

$$
\left(x^{n}-\lambda^{n} e\right)=(x-\lambda e)\left(x^{n-1}+\lambda x^{n-2}+\cdots+\lambda^{n-1} e\right)
$$

Multiply both sides of (2) by $\left(x^{n}-\lambda^{n} e\right)^{-1}$. This shows that $x-\lambda e$ is invertible, hence $\lambda \notin \sigma(x)$.

So if $\lambda \in \sigma(x)$, then $\lambda^{n} \in \sigma\left(x^{n}\right)$ for $n=1,2,3, \ldots$ Corollary 3 to Theorem 18.4 shows that $\left|\lambda^{n}\right| \leq\left\|x^{n}\right\|$, and therefore $|\lambda| \leq\left\|x^{n}\right\|^{1 / n}$. This gives

$$
\rho(x) \leq \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \inf \left\|x^{n}\right\|^{1 / n}
$$

Now if $|\lambda|>\|x\|$, it is easy to verify that

$$
(\lambda e-x) \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \lambda^{-n-1} x^{n}=e
$$

The above series is therefore $-(x-\lambda e)^{-1}$. Let $\Phi$ be a bounded linear functional on $A$ and define $f$ as in Theorem 18.5. By (4), the expansion

$$
f(\lambda)=-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \Phi\left(x^{n}\right) \lambda^{-n-1}
$$

is valid for all $\lambda$ such that $|\lambda|>\|x\|$. By Theorem 18.5, $f$ is holomorphic outside $\sigma(x)$, hence in the set $\{\lambda:|\lambda|>\rho(x)\}$. It follows that the power series (5) converges if $|\lambda|>\rho(x)$. In particular,

$$
\sup _{n}\left|\Phi\left(\lambda^{-n} x^{n}\right)\right|<\infty \quad(|\lambda|>\rho(x))
$$

for every bounded linear functional $\Phi$ on $A$.

It is a consequence of the Hahn-Banach theorem (Sec. 5.21) that the norm of any element of $A$ is the same as its norm as a linear functional on the dual space of $A$. Since (6) holds for every $\Phi$, we can now apply the Banach-Steinhaus theorem and conclude that to each $\lambda$ with $|\lambda|>\rho(x)$ there corresponds a real number $C(\lambda)$ such that

$$
\left\|\lambda^{-n} x^{n}\right\| \leq C(\lambda) \quad(n=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

Multiply (7) by $|\lambda|^{n}$ and take $n$th roots. This gives

$$
\left\|x^{n}\right\|^{1 / n} \leq|\lambda|[C(\lambda)]^{1 / n} \quad(n=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

if $|\lambda|>\rho(x)$, and hence

$$
\limsup _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left\|x^{n}\right\|^{1 / n} \leq \rho(x)
$$

The theorem follows from (3) and (9)."
16.20,"If $\Gamma$ and $Q$ are as described in Sec. 16.18, there exists a function $\lambda \in H(\Pi^{+})$ such that

(a) $\lambda \circ \varphi=\lambda$ for every $\varphi \in \Gamma$.

(b) $\lambda$ is one-to-one on $Q$.

(c) The range $\Omega$ of $\lambda$ [which is the same as $\lambda(Q)$, by (a)], is the region consisting of all complex numbers different from 0 and 1.

(d) $\lambda$ has the real axis as its natural boundary.","Let $Q_{0}$ be the right half of $Q$. More precisely, $Q_{0}$ consists of all $z \in \Pi^{+}$such that

$$
0<\operatorname{Re} z<1, \quad|2 z-1|>1
$$

By Theorem 14.19 (and Remarks 14.20) there is a continuous function $h$ on $\bar{Q}_{0}$ which is one-to-one on $\bar{Q}_{0}$ and holomorphic in $Q_{0}$, such that $h\left(Q_{0}\right)=\Pi^{+}$, $h(0)=0, h(1)=1$, and $h(\infty)=\infty$. The reflection principle (Theorem 11.14) shows that the formula

$$
h(-x+i y)=\overline{h(x+i y)}
$$

extends $h$ to a continuous function on the closure $\bar{Q}$ of $Q$ which is a conformal mapping of the interior of $Q$ onto the complex plane minus the nonnegative real axis. We also see that $h$ is one-to-one on $Q$, that $h(Q)$ is the region $\Omega$ described in $(c)$, that

$$
h(-1+i y)=h(1+i y)=h(\tau(-1+i y)) \quad(0<y<\infty)
$$

and that

$$
h\left(-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2} e^{i \theta}\right)=h\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2} e^{i(\pi-\theta)}\right)=h\left(\sigma\left(-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2} e^{i \theta}\right)\right) \quad(0<\theta<\pi)
$$

Since $h$ is real on the boundary of $Q$, (3) and (4) follow from (2) and the definitions of $\sigma$ and $\tau$.

We now define the function $\lambda$ :

$$
\lambda(z)=h\left(\varphi^{-1}(z)\right) \quad(z \in \varphi(Q), \varphi \in \Gamma)
$$

By Theorem 16.19, each $z \in \Pi^{+}$lies in $\varphi(Q)$ for one and only one $\varphi \in \Gamma$. Thus (5) defines $\lambda(z)$ for $z \in \Pi^{+}$, and we see immediately that $\lambda$ has properties $(a)$ to $(c)$ and that $\lambda$ is holomorphic in the interior of each of the sets $\varphi(Q)$.

It follows from (3) and (4) that $\lambda$ is continuous on

$$
Q \cup \tau^{-1}(Q) \cup \sigma^{-1}(Q)
$$

hence on an open set $V$ which contains $Q$. Theorem 16.8 now shows that $\lambda$ is holomorphic in $V$. Since $\Pi^{+}$is covered by the union of the sets $\varphi(V), \varphi \in \Gamma$, and since $\lambda \circ \varphi=\lambda$, we conclude that $\lambda \in H(\Pi^{+})$.

Finally, the set of all numbers $\varphi(0)=b / d$ is dense on the real axis. If $\lambda$ could be analytically continued to a region which properly contains $\Pi^{+}$, the zeros of $\lambda$ would have a limit point in this region, which is impossible since $\lambda$ is not constant."
11.9,"Suppose $u$ is a continuous real function on the closed unit disc $\bar{U}$, and suppose $u$ is harmonic in $U$. Then (in $U$ ) $u$ is the Poisson integral of its restriction to $T$, and $u$ is the real part of the holomorphic function

Put $h=u-u_{1}$. Then $h$ is continuous on $\bar{U}$ (apply Theorem 11.8 to $u_{1}$ ), $h$ is harmonic in $U$, and $h=0$ at all points of $T$. Assume (this will lead to a contradiction) that $h\left(z_{0}\right)>0$ for some $z_{0} \in U$. Fix $\epsilon$ so that $0<\epsilon<h\left(z_{0}\right)$, and define

$$
g(z)=h(z)+\epsilon|z|^{2} \quad(z \in \bar{U}) .
$$

Then $g\left(z_{0}\right) \geq h\left(z_{0}\right)>\epsilon$. Since $g \in C(\bar{U})$ and since $g=\epsilon$ at all points of $T$, there exists a point $z_{1} \in U$ at which $g$ has a local maximum. This implies that $g_{x x} \leq 0$ and $g_{y y} \leq 0$ at $z_{1}$. But (2) shows that the Laplacian of $g$ is $4 \epsilon>0$, and we have a contradiction.

Thus $u-u_{1} \leq 0$. The same argument shows that $u_{1}-u \leq 0$. Hence $u=$ $u_{1}$, and the proof is complete."

(If not, replace $u_{n}$ by $u_{n}-u_{1}$.) Put $u=\sup u_{n}$, let $A=\{z \in \Omega: u(z)<\infty\}$, and $B=\Omega-A$. Choose $\bar{D}(a ; R) \subset \Omega$. The Poisson kernel satisfies the inequalities

$$
\frac{R-r}{R+r} \leq \frac{R^{2}-r^{2}}{R^{2}-2 r R \cos (\theta-t)+r} \leq \frac{R+r}{R-r}

for $0 \leq r<R$. Hence

$$
\frac{R-r}{R+r} u_{n}(a) \leq u_{n}\left(a+r e^{i \theta}\right) \leq \frac{R+r}{R-r} u_{n}(a)
$$

The same inequalities hold with $u$ in place of $u_{n}$. It follows that either $u(z)=\infty$ for all $z \in D(a ; R)$ or $u(z)<\infty$ for all $z \in D(a ; R)$.

Thus both $A$ and $B$ are open; and since $\Omega$ is connected, we have either $A=\varnothing$ (in which case there is nothing to prove) or $A=\Omega$. In the latter case, the monotone convergence theorem shows that the Poisson formula holds for $u$ in every disc in $\Omega$. Hence $u$ is harmonic in $\Omega$. Whenever a sequence of continuous functions converges monotonically to a continuous limit, the convergence is uniform on compact sets ([26], Theorem 7.13). This completes the proof."
11.28,"Suppose that $\mathscr{F}$ is a pointwise bounded equicontinuous collection of complex functions on a metric space $X$, and that $X$ contains a countable dense subset $E$.

Every sequence $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ in $\mathscr{F}$ has then a subsequence that converges uniformly on every compact subset of $X$.","Let $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \ldots$ be an enumeration of the points of $E$. Let $S_{0}$ be the set of all positive integers. Suppose $k \geq 1$ and an infinite set $S_{k-1} \subset S_{0}$ has been chosen. Since $\left\{f_{n}\left(x_{k}\right): n \in S_{k-1}\right\}$ is a bounded sequence of complex numbers, it has a convergent subsequence. In other words, there is an infinite set $S_{k} \subset S_{k-1}$ so that $\lim f_{n}\left(x_{k}\right)$ exists as $n \rightarrow \infty$ within $S_{k}$.

Continuing in this way, we obtain infinite sets $S_{0} \supset S_{1} \supset S_{2} \supset \cdots$ with the property that $\lim f_{n}\left(x_{j}\right)$ exists, for $1 \leq j \leq k$, if $n \rightarrow \infty$ within $S_{k}$.

Let $r_{k}$ be the $k$ th term of $S_{k}$ (with respect to the natural order of the positive integers) and put

$$
S=\left\{r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, \ldots\right\}

For each $k$ there are then at most $k-1$ terms of $S$ that are not in $S_{k}$.

Hence $\lim f_{n}(x)$ exists, for every $x \in E$, as $n \rightarrow \infty$ within $S$.

(The construction of $S$ from $\left\{S_{k}\right\}$ is the so-called diagonal process.)

Now let $K \subset X$ be compact, pick $\epsilon>0$. By equicontinuity, there is a $\delta>0$ so that $\rho(p, q)<\delta$ implies $\left|f_{n}(p)-f_{n}(q)\right|<\epsilon$, for all $n$. Cover $K$ with open balls $B_{1}, \ldots, B_{M}$ of radius $\delta / 2$. Since $E$ is dense in $X$ there are points $p_{i} \in B_{i} \cap E$ for $1 \leq i \leq M$. Since $p_{i} \in E, \lim f_{n}\left(p_{i}\right)$ exists, as $n \rightarrow \infty$ within $S$. Hence there is an integer $N$ such that

$$
\left|f_{m}\left(p_{i}\right)-f_{n}\left(p_{i}\right)\right|<\epsilon

for $i=1, \ldots, M$, if $m>N, n>N$, and $m$ and $n$ are in $S$.

To finish, pick $x \in K$. Then $x \in B_{i}$ for some $i$, and $\rho\left(x, p_{i}\right)<\delta$. Our choice of $\delta$ and $N$ shows that

17.26,"If $1<p<\infty$, then there is a constant $A_{p}<\infty$ such that the inequality

$$
\|\psi h\|_{p} \leq A_{p}\|h\|_{p}

holds for every $h \in L^{p}(T)$.

More explicitly, the conclusion is that $\psi h$ (defined in Sec. 17.24) is in $H^{p}$, and that

$$
\int_{T}\left|(\psi h)_{r}\right|^{p} d \sigma \leq A_{p}^{p} \int_{T}|h|^{p} d \sigma \quad \cdot(0 \leq r<1)
$$

where $d \sigma=d \theta / 2 \pi$ is the normalized Lebesgue measure on $T$.

Note that $h$ is not required to be a real function in this theorem, which asserts that $\psi: L^{p} \rightarrow H^{p}$ is a bounded linear operator.","Assume first that $1<p \leq 2$, that $h \in L^{p}(T), h \geq 0, h \not \equiv 0$, and let $u$ be the real part of $f=\psi h$. Formula 11.5(2) shows that $u=P[h]$, hence $u>0$ in $U$. Since $U$ is simply connected and $f$ has no zero in $U$, there is a $g \in H(U)$ such that $g=f^{p}, g(0)>0$. Also, $u=|f| \cos \varphi$, where $\varphi$ is a real function with domain $U$ that satisfies $|\varphi|<\pi / 2$.

If $\alpha=\alpha_{p}$ and $\beta=\beta_{p}$ are chosen as in Lemma 17.25, it follows that

$$
\int_{T}\left|f_{r}\right|^{p} d \sigma \leq \beta \int_{T}\left(u_{r}\right)^{p} d \sigma-\alpha \int_{T}\left|f_{r}\right|^{p} \cos \left(p \varphi_{r}\right) d \sigma
$$

for $0 \leq r<1$.

Note that $|f|^{p} \cos p \varphi=\operatorname{Re} g$. The mean value property of harmonic functions shows therefore that the last integral in (3) is equal to $\operatorname{Re} g(0)>0$. Hence

$$
\int_{T}\left|f_{r}\right|^{p} d \sigma \leq \beta \int_{T} h^{p} d \sigma \quad(0 \leq r<1)
$$

because $u=P[h]$ implies $\left\|u_{r}\right\|_{p} \leq\|h\|_{p}$. Thus

$$
\|\psi h\|_{p} \leq \beta^{1 / p}\|h\|_{p}
$$

if $h \in L^{p}(T), h \geq 0$.

If $h$ is an arbitrary (complex) function in $L^{p}(T)$, the preceding result applies to the positive and negative parts of the real and imaginary parts of $h$.

This proves (2), for $1<p \leq 2$, with $A_{p}=4 \beta^{1 / p}$.

To complete the proof, consider the case $2<p<\infty$. Let $w \in L^{q}(T)$, where $q$ is the exponent conjugate to $p$. Put $\tilde{w}\left(e^{i \theta}\right)=w\left(e^{-i \theta}\right)$. A simple computation, using Fubini's theorem, shows for any $h \in L^{p}(T)$ that

$$
\int_{T}(\psi h)_{r} \tilde{w} d \sigma=\int_{T}(\psi w)_{r} \tilde{h} d \sigma \quad(0 \leq r<1)
$$

Since $q<2$, (2) holds with $w$ and $q$ in place of $h$ and $p$, so that (6) leads to

$$
\left|\int_{T}(\psi h)_{r} \tilde{w} d \sigma\right| \leq A_{q}\|w\|_{q}\|h\|_{p}
$$

Now let $w$ range over the unit ball of $L^{q}(T)$ and take the supremum on the left side of (7). The result is

$$
\left\{\int_{T}\left|(\psi h)_{r}\right|^{p} d \sigma\right\}^{1 / p} \leq A_{q}\left\{\int_{T}|h|^{p} d \sigma\right\}^{1 / p} \quad(0 \leq r<1)
$$

Hence (2) holds again, with $A_{p} \leq A_{q}$.

(If we take the smallest admissible values for $A_{p}$ and $A_{q}$, the last calculation can be reversed, and shows that $A_{p}=A_{q}$.)"
14.8,Every simply connected region $\Omega$ in the plane (other than the plane itself) is conformally equivalent to the open unit disc $U$.,"Suppose $\Omega$ is a simply connected region in the plane and let $w_{0}$ be a complex number, $w_{0} \notin \Omega$. Let $\Sigma$ be the class of all $\psi \in H(\Omega)$ which are oneto-one in $\Omega$ and which map $\Omega$ into $U$. We have to prove that some $\psi \in \Sigma$ maps $\Omega$ onto $U$.

We first prove that $\Sigma$ is not empty. Since $\Omega$ is simply connected, there exists a $\varphi \in H(\Omega)$ so that $\varphi^{2}(z)=z-w_{0}$ in $\Omega$. If $\varphi\left(z_{1}\right)=\varphi\left(z_{2}\right)$, then also $\varphi^{2}\left(z_{1}\right)=\varphi^{2}\left(z_{2}\right)$, hence $z_{1}=z_{2}$; thus $\varphi$ is one-to-one. The same argument shows that there are no two distinct points $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ in $\Omega$ such that $\varphi\left(z_{1}\right)=$ $-\varphi\left(z_{2}\right)$. Since $\varphi$ is an open mapping, $\varphi(\Omega)$ contains a disc $D(a ; r)$, with $0<r<|a|$. The disc $D(-a ; r)$ therefore fails to intersect $\varphi(\Omega)$, and if we define $\psi=r /(\varphi+a)$, we see that $\psi \in \Sigma$.

The next step consists in showing that if $\psi \in \Sigma$, if $\psi(\Omega)$ does not cover all of $U$, and if $z_{0} \in \Omega$, then there exists a $\psi_{1} \in \Sigma$ with

$$
\left|\psi_{1}^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right)\right|>\left|\psi^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right)\right| .
$$

It will be convenient to use the functions $\varphi_{\alpha}$ defined by

$$
\varphi_{\alpha}(z)=\frac{z-\alpha}{1-\bar{\alpha} z} .
$$

For $\alpha \in U, \varphi_{\alpha}$ is a one-to-one mapping of $U$ onto $U$; its inverse is $\varphi_{-\alpha}$ (Theorem 12.4).

Suppose $\psi \in \Sigma, \alpha \in U$, and $\alpha \notin \psi(\Omega)$. Then $\varphi_{\alpha} \circ \psi \in \Sigma$, and $\varphi_{\alpha} \circ \psi$ has no zero in $\Omega$; hence there exists a $g \in H(\Omega)$ such that $g^{2}=\varphi_{\alpha} \circ \psi$. We see that $g$ is one-to-one (as in the proof that $\Sigma \neq \varnothing$ ), hence $g \in \Sigma$; and if $\psi_{1}=\varphi_{\beta} \circ g$, where $\beta=g\left(z_{0}\right)$, it follows that $\psi_{1} \in \Sigma$. With the notation $w^{2}=s(w)$, we now have

$$
\psi=\varphi_{-\alpha} \circ S \circ g=\varphi_{-\alpha} \circ S \circ \varphi_{-\beta} \circ \psi_{1} .
$$

Since $\psi_{1}\left(z_{0}\right)=0$, the chain rule gives

$$
\psi^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right)=F^{\prime}(0) \psi_{1}^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right)
$$

where $F=\varphi_{-\alpha} \circ S \circ \varphi_{-\beta}$. We see that $F(U) \subset U$ and that $F$ is not one-toone in $U$. Therefore $\left|F^{\prime}(0)\right|<1$, by the Schwarz lemma (see Sec. 12.5), so that $\left|\psi^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right)\right|<\left|\psi_{1}^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right)\right|$. [Note that $\psi^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right) \neq 0$, since $\psi$ is one-to-one in $\Omega$.]

Fix $z_{0} \in \Omega$, and put

$$
\eta=\sup \left\{\left|\psi^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right)\right|: \psi \in \Sigma\right\} .
$$

The foregoing makes it clear that any $h \in \Sigma$ for which $\left|h^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right)\right|=\eta$ will map $\Omega$ onto $U$. Hence the proof will be completed as soon as we prove the existence of such an $h$.

Since $|\psi(z)|<1$ for all $\psi \in \Sigma$ and $z \in \Omega$, Theorem 14.6 shows that $\Sigma$ is a normal family. The definition of $\eta$ shows that there is a sequence $\left\{\psi_{n}\right\}$ in $\Sigma$ such that $\left|\psi_{n}^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right)\right| \rightarrow \eta$, and by normality of $\Sigma$ we can extract a subsequence (again denoted by $\left\{\psi_{n}\right\}$, for simplicity) which converges, uniformly on compact subsets of $\Omega$, to a limit $h \in H(\Omega)$. By Theorem 10.28, $\left|h^{\prime}\left(z_{0}\right)\right|=\eta$. Since $\Sigma \neq \varnothing, \eta>0$, so $h$ is not constant. Since $\psi_{n}(\Omega) \subset U$, for $n=1,2,3, \ldots$, we have $h(\Omega) \subset \bar{U}$, but the open mapping theorem shows that actually $h(\Omega) \subset U$.

So all that remains to be shown is that $h$ is one-to-one. Fix distinct points $z_{1}$ and $z_{2} \in \Omega$; put $\alpha=h\left(z_{1}\right)$ and $\alpha_{n}=\psi_{n}\left(z_{1}\right)$ for $n=1,2,3, \ldots$; and let $\bar{D}$ be a closed circular disc in \Omega$ with center at $z_{2}$, such that $z_{1} \notin \bar{D}$ and such that $h-\alpha$ has no zero on the boundary of $\bar{D}$. This is possible, since the zeros of $h-\alpha$ have no limit point in $\Omega$. The functions $\psi_{n}-\alpha_{n}$ converge to $h-\alpha$, uniformly on $\bar{D}$; they have no zero in $D$ since they are one-to-one and have a zero at $z_{1}$; it now follows from Rouch\'e's theorem that $h-\alpha$ has no zero in $D$; in particular, $h\left(z_{2}\right) \neq h\left(z_{1}\right)$.

Thus $h \in \Sigma$, and the proof is complete."

Now suppose $f \in C_{c}\left(R^{k}\right), f$ is real, $W$ is an open $k$-cell which contains the support of $f$, and $\epsilon>0$. The uniform continuity of $f([26]$, Theorem 4.19) shows that there is an integer $N$ and that there are functions $g$ and $h$ with support in $W$, such that (i) $g$ and $h$ are constant on each box belonging to $\Omega_{N}$, (ii) $g \leq f \leq h$, and (iii) $h-g<\epsilon$. If $n>N$, Property $2.19(c)$ shows that

$$
\Lambda_{N} g=\Lambda_{n} g \leq \Lambda_{n} f \leq \Lambda_{n} h=\Lambda_{N} h
$$

Thus the upper and lower limits of $\left\{\Lambda_{n} f\right\}$ differ by at most $\epsilon$ vol $(W)$, and since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary, we have proved the existence of

$$
\Lambda f=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \Lambda_{n} f \quad\left(f \in C_{c}\left(R^{k}\right)\right)
$$

It is immediate that $\Lambda$ is a positive linear functional on $C_{c}\left(R^{k}\right)$. (In fact, $\Lambda f$ is precisely the Riemann integral of $f$ over $R^{k}$. We went through the preceding construction in order not to have to rely on any theorems about Riemann integrals in several variables.)

We define $m$ and $\mathfrak{M}$ to be the measure and $\sigma$-algebra associated with this $\Lambda$ as in Theorem 2.14.

Since Theorem 2.14 gives us a complete measure and since $R^{k}$ is $\sigma$ compact, Theorem 2.17 implies assertion $(b)$ of Theorem 2.20.

To prove (a), let $W$ be the open cell 2.19(4), let $E_{r}$ be the union of those boxes belonging to $\Omega_{r}$ whose closures lie in $W$, choose $f_{r}$ so that $\bar{E}_{r} \prec$ $f_{r} \prec W$, and put $g_{r}=\max \left\{f_{1}, \ldots, f_{r}\right\}$. Our construction of $\Lambda$ shows that

$$
\operatorname{vol}\left(E_{r}\right) \leq \Lambda f_{r} \leq \Lambda g_{r} \leq \text { vol } W
$$

As $r \rightarrow \infty, \operatorname{vol}\left(E_{r}\right) \rightarrow \operatorname{vol}(W)$, and

$$
\Lambda g_{r}=\int g_{r} d m \rightarrow m(W)
$$

by the monotone convergence theorem, since $g_{r}(x) \rightarrow \chi_{W}(x)$ for all $x \in R^{k}$. Thus $m(W)=\operatorname{vol}(W)$ for every open cell $W$, and since every $k$-cell is the intersection of a decreasing sequence of open $k$-cells, we obtain $(a)$.

The proofs of $(c),(d)$, and $(e)$ will use the following observation: If $\lambda$ is a positive Borel measure on $R^{k}$ and $\lambda(E)=m(E)$ for all boxes $E$, then the same equality holds for all open sets $E$, by property $2.19(d)$, and therefore for all Borel sets $E$, since $\lambda$ and $m$ are regular (Theorem 2.18).

To prove (c), fix $x \in R^{k}$ and define $\lambda(E)=m(E+x)$. It is clear that $\lambda$ is then a measure; by $(a), \lambda(E)=m(E)$ for all boxes, hence $m(E+x)=m(E)$ for all Borel sets $E$. The same equality holds for every $E \in \mathfrak{M}$, because of $(b)$.

Suppose next that $\mu$ satisfies the hypotheses of $(d)$. Let $Q_{0}$ be a 1-box, put $c=\mu\left(Q_{0}\right)$. Since $Q_{0}$ is the union of $2^{n k}$ disjoint $2^{-n}$ boxes that are translates of each other, we have

$$
2^{n k} \mu(Q)=\mu\left(Q_{0}\right)=c m\left(Q_{0}\right)=c \cdot 2^{n k} m(Q)
$$

for every $2^{-n}$-box $Q$. Property $2.19(d)$ implies now that $\mu(E)=c m(E)$ for all open sets $E \subset R^{k}$. This proves $(d)$.

To prove (e), let $T: R^{k} \rightarrow R^{k}$ be linear. If the range of $T$ is a subspace $Y$ of lower dimension, then $m(Y)=0$ and the desired conclusion holds with $\Delta(T)=0$. In the other case, elementary linear algebra tells us that $T$ is a one-to-one map of $R^{k}$ onto $R^{k}$ whose inverse is also linear. Thus $T$ is a homeomorphism of $R^{k}$ onto $R^{k}$, so that $T(E)$ is a Borel set for every Borel set $E$, and we can therefore define a positive Borel measure $\mu$ on $R^{k}$ by

$$
\mu(E)=m(T(E))
$$

The linearity of $T$, combined with the translation-invariance of $m$, gives

$$
\mu(E+x)=m(T(E+x))=m(T(E)+T x)=m(T(E))=\mu(E)
$$

Thus $\mu$ is translation-invariant, and the first assertion of $(e)$ follows from (d), first for Borel sets $E$, then for all $E \in \mathfrak{M}$ by $(b)$.

To find $\Delta(T)$, we merely need to know $m(T(E)) / m(E)$ for one set $E$ with $0<m(E)<\infty$. If $T$ is a rotation, let $E$ be the unit ball of $R^{k}$; then $T(E)=E$, and $\Delta(T)=1$."
11.30 (a),"Suppose $u$ is harmonic in $U, 1 \leq p \leq \infty$, and

$$
\sup _{0<r<1}\left\|u_{r}\right\|_{p}=M<\infty
$$

If $p=1$, it follows that there is a unique complex Borel measure $\mu$ on $T$ so that $u=P[d \mu]$","Assume first that $p=1$. Define linear functionals $\Lambda_{r}$ on $C(T)$ by

$$
\Lambda_{r} g=\int_{T} g u_{r} d \sigma \quad(0 \leq r<1)
$$

By (1), $\left\|\Lambda_{r}\right\| \leq M$. By Theorems 11.29 and 6.19 there is a measure $\mu$ on $T$, with $\|\mu\| \leq M$, and a sequence $r_{j} \rightarrow 1$, so that

$$
\lim _{j \rightarrow \infty} \int_{T} g u_{r_{j}} d \sigma=\int_{T} g d \mu
$$

for every $g \in C(T)$.

Put $h_{j}(z)=u\left(r_{j} z\right)$. Then $h_{j}$ is harmonic in $U$, continuous on $\bar{U}$, and is therefore the Poisson integral of its restriction to $T$ (Theorem 11.9). Fix $z \in U$, and apply (3) with

$$
g\left(e^{i t}\right)=P\left(z, e^{i t}\right)
$$

Since $h_{j}\left(e^{i t}\right)=u_{r_{j}}\left(e^{i t}\right)$, we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
u(z) & =\lim _{j} u\left(r_{j} z\right)=\lim _{j} h_{j}(z) \\
& =\lim _{j} \int_{T} P\left(z, e^{i t}\right) h_{j}\left(e^{i t}\right) d \sigma\left(e^{i t}\right) \\
& =\int_{T} P\left(z, e^{i t}\right) d \mu\left(e^{i t}\right)=P[d \mu](z)
\end{aligned}
$$

If $1<p \leq \infty$, let $q$ be the exponent conjugate to $p$. Then $L^{q}(T)$ is separable. Define $\Lambda_{r}$ as in (2), but for all $g \in L^{q}(T)$. Again, $\left\|\Lambda_{r}\right\| \leq M$. Refer to Theorems 6.16 and 11.29 to deduce, as above, that there is an $f \in L^{p}(T)$, with $\|f\|_{p} \leq M$, so that (3) holds, with $f d \sigma$ in place of $d \mu$, for every $g \in L^{q}(T)$. The rest of the proof is as it was in the case $p=1$.

This establishes the existence assertions in $(a)$ and $(b)$. To prove uniqueness, it suffices to show that $P[d \mu]=0$ implies $\mu=0$.

Pick $f \in C(T)$, put $u=P[f], v=P[d \mu]$. By Fubini's theorem, and the symmetry $P\left(r e^{i \theta}, e^{i t}\right)=P\left(r e^{i t}, e^{i \theta}\right)$,

$$
\int_{T} u_{r} d \mu=\int_{T} v_{r} f d \sigma \quad(0 \leq r<1)
$$

When $v=0$ then $v_{r}=0$, and since $u_{r} \rightarrow f$ uniformly, as $r \rightarrow 1$, we conclude that

$$
\int_{T} f d \mu=0
$$

for every $f \in C(T)$ if $P[d \mu]=0$. By Theorem 6.19, (6) implies that $\mu=0$.

Finally, $(c)$ is a corollary of $(a)$, since $u>0$ implies (1) with $p=1$ :

$$
\int_{T}\left|u_{r}\right| d \sigma=\int_{T} u_{r} d \sigma=u(0) \quad(0 \leq r<1)
$$

by the mean value property of harmonic functions. The functionals $\Lambda_{r}$ used in the proof of $(a)$ are now positive, hence $\mu \geq 0$."
11.30 (b),"Suppose $u$ is harmonic in $U, 1 \leq p \leq \infty$, and

13.12,"If $f \in H(\Omega)$, where $\Omega$ is any open set in the plane, and if $f$ has no zero in $\Omega$, then $\log |f|$ is harmonic in $\Omega$.","To every disc $D \subset \Omega$ there corresponds a function $g \in H(D)$ such that $f=e^{g}$ in $D$. If $u=\operatorname{Re} g$, then $u$ is harmonic in $D$, and $|f|=e^{u}$. Thus $\log |f|$ is harmonic in every disc in $\Omega$, and this gives the desired conclusion."
6.19,"If $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space, then every bounded linear functional $\Phi$ on $C_{0}(X)$ is represented by a unique regular complex Borel measure $\mu$, in the sense that

$$
\Phi f=\int_{X} f d \mu
$$

for every $f \in C_{0}(X)$. Moreover, the norm of $\Phi$ is the total variation of $\mu$ :

$$
\|\Phi\|=|\mu|(X)
$$","We first settle the uniqueness question. Suppose $\mu$ is a regular complex Borel measure on $X$ and $\int f d \mu=0$ for all $f \in C_{0}(X)$. By Theorem 6.12 there is a Borel function $h$, with $|h|=1$, such that $d \mu=h d|\mu|$. For any sequence $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ in $C_{0}(X)$ we then have

$$
|\mu|(X)=\int_{X}\left(\bar{h}-f_{n}\right) h d|\mu| \leq \int_{X}\left|\bar{h}-f_{n}\right| d|\mu|
$$

and since $C_{c}(X)$ is dense in $L^{1}(|\mu|)$ (Theorem 3.14), $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ can be so chosen that the last expression in (3) tends to 0 as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Thus $|\mu|(X)=0$, and $\mu=0$. It is easy to see that the difference of two regular complex Borel measures on $X$ is regular. This shows that at most one $\mu$ corresponds to each $\Phi$.

Now consider a given bounded linear functional $\Phi$ on $C_{0}(X)$. Assume $\|\Phi\|=1$, without loss of generality. We shall construct a positive linear functional $\Lambda$ on $C_{c}(X)$, such that

$$
|\Phi(f)| \leq \Lambda(|f|) \leq\|f\| \quad\left(f \in C_{c}(X)\right)
$$

where $\|f\|$ denotes the supremum norm.

Once we have this $\Lambda$, we associate with it a positive Borel measure $\lambda$, as in Theorem 2.14. The conclusion of Theorem 2.14 shows that $\lambda$ is regular if $\lambda(X)<\infty$. Since

$$
\lambda(X)=\sup \left\{\Lambda f: 0 \leq f \leq 1, f \in C_{c}(X)\right\}
$$

and since $|\Lambda f| \leq 1$ if $\|f\| \leq 1$, we see that actually $\lambda(X) \leq 1$.

We also deduce from (4) that

$$
|\Phi(f)| \leq \Lambda(|f|)=\int_{X}|f| d \lambda=\|f\|_{1} \quad\left(f \in C_{c}(X)\right)
$$

The last norm refers to the space $L^{1}(\lambda)$. Thus $\Phi$ is a linear functional on $C_{c}(X)$ of norm at most 1 , with respect to the $L^{1}(\lambda)$-norm on $C_{c}(X)$. There is a normpreserving extension of $\Phi$ to a linear functional on $L^{1}(\lambda)$, and therefore Theorem 6.16 (the case $p=1$ ) gives a Borel function $g$, with $|g| \leq 1$, such that

$$
\Phi(f)=\int_{X} f g d \lambda \quad\left(f \in C_{c}(X)\right)
$$

Each side of (6) is a continuous functional on $C_{0}(X)$, and $C_{c}(X)$ is dense in $C_{0}(X)$. Hence (6) holds for all $f \in C_{0}(X)$, and we obtain the representation (1) with $d \mu=g d \lambda$.

Since $\|\Phi\|=1,(6)$ shows that

$$
\int_{X}|g| d \lambda \geq \sup \left\{|
\Phi(f)|: f \in C_{0}(X),\|f\| \leq 1\right\}=1
$$

We also know that $\lambda(X) \leq 1$ and $|g| \leq 1$. These facts are compatible only if $\lambda(X)=1$ and $|g|=1$ a.e. [ $\lambda$ ]. Thus $d|\mu|=|g| d \lambda=d \lambda$, by Theorem 6.13, and

$$
|\mu|(X)=\lambda(X)=1=\|\Phi\|
$$

which proves (2).

So all depends on finding a positive linear functional $\Lambda$ that satisfies (4). If $f \in C_{c}^{+}(X)$ [the class of all nonnegative real members of $\left.C_{c}(X)\right]$, define

$$
\Lambda f=\sup \left\{|
\Phi(h)|: h \in C_{c}(X),|h| \leq f\right\} .
$$

Then $\Lambda f \geq 0, \Lambda$ satisfies (4), $0 \leq f_{1} \leq f_{2}$ implies $\Lambda f_{1} \leq \Lambda f_{2}$, and $\Lambda(c f)=c \Lambda f$ if $c$ is a positive constant. We have to show that

$$
\Lambda(f+g)=\Lambda f+\Lambda g \quad\left(f \text { and } g \in C_{c}^{+}(X)\right)
$$

and we then have to extend $\Lambda$ to a linear functional on $C_{c}(X)$.

Fix $f$ and $g \in C_{c}^{+}(X)$. If $\epsilon>0$, there exist $h_{1}$ and $h_{2} \in C_{c}(X)$ such that $\left|h_{1}\right| \leq f,\left|h_{2}\right| \leq g$, and

$$
\Lambda f \leq\left|
\Phi\left(h_{1}\right)\right|+\epsilon, \quad \Lambda g \leq\left|
\Phi\left(h_{2}\right)\right|+\epsilon .
$$

There are complex numbers $\alpha_{i},\left|\alpha_{i}\right|=1$, so that $\alpha_{i} \Phi\left(h_{i}\right)=\left|
\Phi\left(h_{i}\right)\right|, i=1,2$. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Lambda f+\Lambda g & \leq\left|
\Phi\left(h_{1}\right)\right|+\left|
\Phi\left(h_{2}\right)\right|+2 \epsilon \\
& =\Phi\left(\alpha_{1} h_{1}+\alpha_{2} h_{2}\right)+2 \epsilon \\
& \leq \Lambda\left(\left|h_{1}\right|+\left|h_{2}\right|\right)+2 \epsilon \\
& \leq \Lambda(f+g)+2 \epsilon,
\end{aligned}
$$

so that the inequality $\geq$ holds in (10).

Next, choose $h \in C_{c}(X)$, subject only to the condition $|h| \leq f+g$, let $V=\{x: f(x)+g(x)>0\}$, and define

$$
\begin{aligned}
& h_{1}(x)=\frac{f(x) h(x)}{f(x)+g(x)}, \quad h_{2}(x)=\frac{g(x) h(x)}{f(x)+g(x)} \quad(x \in V), \\
& h_{1}(x)=h_{2}(x)=0 \quad(x \notin V) .
\end{aligned}
$$

It is clear that $h_{1}$ is continuous at every point of $V$. If $x_{0} \notin V$, then $h\left(x_{0}\right)=0$; since $h$ is continuous and since $\left|h_{1}(x)\right| \leq|h(x)|$ for all $x \in X$, it follows that $x_{0}$ is a point of continuity of $h_{1}$. Thus $h_{1} \in C_{c}(X)$, and the same holds for $h_{2}$.

Since $h_{1}+h_{2}=h$ and $\left|h_{1}\right| \leq f,\left|h_{2}\right| \leq g$, we have

$$
|\Phi(h)|=\left|\Phi\left(h_{1}\right)+\Phi\left(h_{2}\right)\right| \leq\left|\Phi\left(h_{1}\right)\right|+\left|\Phi\left(h_{2}\right)\right| \leq \Lambda f+\Lambda g .
$$

Hence $\Lambda(f+g) \leq \Lambda f+\Lambda g$, and we have proved (10).

If $f$ is now a real function, $f \in C_{c}(X)$, then $2 f^{+}=|f|+f$, so that $f^{+} \in$ $C_{c}^{+}(X)$; likewise, $f^{-} \in C_{c}^{+}(X)$; and since $f=f^{+}-f^{-}$, it is natural to define

$$
\Lambda f=\Lambda f^{+}-\Lambda f^{-} \quad\left(f \in C_{c}(X), f \text { real }\right)
$$

and

$$
\Lambda(u+i v)=\Lambda u+i \Lambda v .
$$

Simple algebraic manipulations, just like those which occur in the proof of Theorem 1.32, show now that our extended functional $\Lambda$ is linear on $C_{c}(X)$. This completes the proof."
17.2,"If $u$ is subharmonic in $\Omega$, and if $\varphi$ is a monotonically increasing convex function on $R^{1}$, then $\varphi \circ u$ is subharmonic.","First, $\varphi \circ u$ is upper semicontinuous, since $\varphi$ is increasing and continuous. Next, if $\bar{D}(a ; r) \subset \Omega$, we have

$$
\varphi(u(a)) \leq \varphi\left(\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} u\left(a+r e^{i \theta}\right) d \theta\right) \leq \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \varphi\left(u\left(a+r e^{i \theta}\right)\right) d \theta .
$$

The first of these inequalities holds since $\varphi$ is increasing and $u$ is subharmonic; the second follows from the convexity of $\varphi$, by Theorem 3.3."
14.19,"If $\Omega$ is a bounded simply connected region in the plane and if every boundary point of $\Omega$ is simple, then every conformal mapping of $\Omega$ onto $U$ extends to a homeomorphism of $\bar{\Omega}$ onto $\bar{U}$","Suppose $f \in H(\Omega), f(\Omega)=U$, and $f$ is one-to-one. By Theorem 14.18 we can extend $f$ to a mapping of $\bar{\Omega}$ into $\bar{U}$ such that $f\left(\alpha_{n}\right) \rightarrow f(z)$ whenever $\left\{\alpha_{n}\right\}$ is a sequence in $\Omega$ which converges to $z$. If $\left\{z_{n}\right\}$ is a sequence in $\bar{\Omega}$ which converges to $z$, there exist points $\alpha_{n} \in \Omega$ such that $\left|\alpha_{n}-z_{n}\right|<1 / n$ and $\left|f\left(\alpha_{n}\right)-f\left(z_{n}\right)\right|<1 / n$. Thus $\alpha_{n} \rightarrow z$, hence $f\left(\alpha_{n}\right) \rightarrow f(z)$, and this shows that $f\left(z_{n}\right) \rightarrow f(z)$.

We have now proved that our extension of $f$ is continuous on $\bar{\Omega}$. Also $U \subset f(\bar{\Omega}) \subset \bar{U}$. The compactness of $\bar{U}$ implies that $f(\bar{\Omega})$ is compact. Hence $f(\bar{\Omega})=\bar{U}$.

Theorem $14.18(b)$ shows that $f$ is one-to-one on $\bar{\Omega}$. Since every continuous one-to-one mapping of a compact set has a continuous inverse ([26], Theorem 4.17), the proof is complete."
11.32,"To every $f \in H^{\infty}$ corresponds a function $f^{*} \in L^{\infty}(T)$, defined almost everywhere by

In particular, if $f^{*}=0$ a.e., then $\left\|f^{*}\right\|_{\infty}=0$, hence $\|f\|_{\infty}=0$, hence $f=0$.

f(x)=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \frac{\left(D^{j} f\right)(a)}{j !}(x-a)^{j}+\frac{1}{(n-1) !} \int_{a}^{x}(x-t)^{n-1}\left(D^{n} f\right)(t) d t
$$

which one obtains by repeated integrations by part. By (2) the last term in (4) (the ""remainder"") is dominated by

$$
n \beta B^{n}\left|\int_{a}^{x}(x-t)^{n-1} d t\right|=\beta|B(x-a)|^{n}
$$

If $|B(x-a)|<1$, this tends to 0 as $n \rightarrow \infty$, and (3) follows.

We can now replace $x$ in (3) by any complex number $z$ such that $|z-a|<1 / B$. This defines a holomorphic function $F_{a}$ in the disc with center at $a$ and radius $1 / B$, and $F_{a}(x)=f(x)$ if $x$ is real and $|x-a|<1 / B$. The various functions $F_{a}$ are therefore analytic continuations of each other; they form a holomorphic extension $F$ of $f$ in the strip $|y|<1 / B$.

If $0<\delta<1 / B$ and $z=a+i y,|y|<\delta$, then

$$
|F(z)|=\left|F_{a}(z)\right|=\left|\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{\left(D^{n} f\right)(a)}{n !}(i y)^{n}\right| \leq \beta \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(B \delta)^{n}=\frac{\beta}{1-B \delta}
$$

This shows that $F$ is bounded in the strip $|y|<\delta$, and the proof is complete."

18.13,"If $A$ is a commutative complex algebra with unit, every proper ideal of $A$ is contained in a maximal ideal. If, in addition, $A$ is a Banach algebra, every maximal ideal of $A$ is closed.","The first part is an almost immediate consequence of the Hausdorff maximality principle (and holds in any commutative ring with unit). Let $I$ be a proper ideal of $A$. Partially order the collection $\mathscr{P}$ of all proper ideals of $A$ which contain $I$ (by set inclusion), and let $M$ be the union of the ideals in some maximal linearly ordered subcollection $\mathscr{2}$ of $\mathscr{P}$. Then $M$ is an ideal (being the union of a linearly ordered collection of ideals), $I \subset M$, and $M \neq$ $A$, since no member of $\mathscr{P}$ contains the unit of $A$. The maximality of $\mathscr{2}$ implies that $M$ is a maximal ideal of $A$.

If $A$ is a Banach algebra, the closure $\bar{M}$ of $M$ is also an ideal (we leave the details of the proof of this statement to the reader). Since $M$ contains no invertible element of $A$ and since the set of all invertible elements is open, we have $\bar{M} \neq A$, and the maximality of $M$ therefore shows that $\bar{M}=M$."

Since $h(e)=1$, this gives $h(x)=\lambda$.

On the other hand, if $\lambda \notin \sigma(x)$, then $(x-\lambda e) y=e$ for some $y \in A$. It follows that $h(x-\lambda e) h(y)=1$ for every $h \in \Delta$, so that $h(x-\lambda e) \neq 0$, or $h(x) \neq \lambda$."

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_{i}(z) g_{i}(z)=1 \quad(z \in \bar{U})
$$","Since sums, products, and uniform limits of holomorphic functions are holomorphic, $A(U)$ is a Banach algebra, with the supremum norm. The set $J$ of all functions $\Sigma f_{i} g_{i}$, where the $g_{i}$ are arbitrary members of $A(U)$, is an ideal of $A(U)$. We have to prove that $J$ contains the unit element 1 of $A(U)$. By Theorem 18.13 this happens if and only if $J$ lies in no maximal ideal of $A(U)$. By Theorem $18.17(a)$ it is therefore enough to prove that there is no homomorphism $h$ of $A(U)$ onto the complex field such that $h\left(f_{i}\right)=0$ for every $i(1 \leq i \leq n)$.

Before we determine these homomorphisms, let us note that the polynomials form a dense subset of $A(U)$. To see this, suppose $f \in A(U)$ and $\epsilon>0$; since $f$ is uniformly continuous on $\bar{U}$, there exists an $r<1$ such that $|f(z)-f(r z)|<\epsilon$ for all $z \in \bar{U}$; the expansion of $f(r z)$ in powers of $z$ converges if $|r z|<1$, hence converges to $f(r z)$ uniformly for $z \in \bar{U}$, and this gives the desired approximation.

Now let $h$ be a complex homomorphism of $A(U)$. Put $f_{0}(z)=z$. Then $f_{0} \in A(U)$. It is obvious that $\sigma\left(f_{0}\right)=\bar{U}$. By Theorem 18.17(d) there exists an $\alpha \in \bar{U}$ such that $h\left(f_{0}\right)=\alpha$. Hence $h\left(f_{0}^{n}\right)=\alpha^{n}=f_{0}^{n}(\alpha)$, for $n=1,2,3, \ldots$, so $h(P)=P(\alpha)$ for every polynomial $P$. Since $h$ is continuous and since the polynomials are dense in $A(U)$, it follows that $h(f)=f(\alpha)$ for every $f \in A(U)$.

Our hypothesis (1) implies that $\left|f_{i}(\alpha)\right|>0$ for at least one index $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$. Thus $h\left(f_{i}\right) \neq 0$.

We have proved that to each $h \in \Delta$ there corresponds at least one of the given functions $f_{i}$ such that $h\left(f_{i}\right) \neq 0$, and this, as we noted above, is enough to prove the theorem.

Note: We have also determined all maximal ideals of $A(U)$, in the course of the preceding proof, since each is the kernel of some $h \in \Delta:$ If $\alpha \in \bar{U}$ and if $M_{\alpha}$ is the set of all $f \in A(U)$ such that $f(\alpha)=0$, then $M_{\alpha}$ is a maximal ideal of $A(U)$, and all maximal ideals of $A(U)$ are obtained in this way.

$A(U)$ is often called the disc algebra."
17.11 (a),"If $0<p<\infty$ and $f \in H^{p}$, then the nontangential maximal functions $N_{\alpha} f$ are in $L^{p}(T)$, for all $\alpha<1$","We begin by proving $(a)$ and $(b)$ for the case $p>1$. Since holomorphic functions are harmonic, Theorem $11.30(b)$ shows that every $f \in H^{p}$ is then the Poisson integral of a function (call it $f^{*}$ ) in $L^{p}(T)$. Hence $N_{\alpha} f \in L^{p}(T)$, by Theorem $11.25(b)$, and $f^{*}\left(e^{i \theta}\right)$ is the nontangential limit of $f$ at almost every $e^{i \theta} \in T$, by Theorem 11.23.

If $0<p \leq 1$ and $f \in H^{p}$, use the factorization

$$
f=B h^{2 / p}
$$

given by Theorem 17.10 , where $B$ is a Blaschke product, $h \in H^{2}$, and $h$ has no zero in $U$. Since $|f| \leq|h|^{2 / p}$ in $U$, it follows that

$$
\left(N_{\alpha} f\right)^{p} \leq\left(N_{\alpha} h\right)^{2}

so that $N_{\alpha} f \in L^{p}(T)$, because $N_{\alpha} h \in L^{2}(T)$."

Then $f$ maps the plane into the region $\Omega$ described in Theorem 16.20.

With each disc $D_{1} \subset \Omega$ there is associated a region $V_{1} \subset \Pi^{+}$(in fact, there are infinitely many such $V_{1}$, one for each $\varphi \in \Gamma$ ) such that $\lambda$ is one-toone on $V_{1}$ and $\lambda\left(V_{1}\right)=D_{1}$; each such $V_{1}$ intersects at most two of the domains $\varphi(Q)$. Corresponding to each choice of $V_{1}$ there is a function $\psi_{1} \in$ $H\left(D_{1}\right)$ such that $\psi_{1}(\lambda(z))=z$ for all $z \in V_{1}$.

If $D_{2}$ is another disc in $\Omega$ and if $D_{1} \cap D_{2} \neq \varnothing$, we can choose a corresponding $V_{2}$ so that $V_{1} \cap V_{2} \neq \varnothing$. The function elements $\left(\psi_{1}, D_{1}\right)$ and $\left(\psi_{2}, D_{2}\right)$ will then be direct analytic continuations of each other. Note that $\psi_{i}\left(D_{i}\right) \subset \Pi^{+}$.

Since the range of $f$ is in $\Omega$, there is a disc $A_{0}$ with center at 0 so that $f\left(A_{0}\right)$ lies in a disc $D_{0}$ in $\Omega$. Choose $\psi_{0} \in H\left(D_{0}\right)$, as above, put $g(z)=\psi_{0}(f(z))$ for $z \in A_{0}$, and let $\gamma$ be any curve in the plane which starts at 0 . The range of $f \circ \gamma$ is a compact subset of $\Omega$. Hence $\gamma$ can be covered by a chain of discs, $A_{0}, \ldots, A_{n}$, so that each $f\left(A_{i}\right)$ lies in a disc $D_{i}$ in $\Omega$, and we can choose $\psi_{i} \in H\left(D_{i}\right)$ so that $\left(\psi_{i}, D_{i}\right)$ is a direct analytic continuation of $\left(\psi_{i-1}, D_{i-1}\right)$, for $i=1, \ldots n$. This gives an analytic continuation of the function element $\left(g, A_{0}\right)$ along the chain $\left\{A_{0}, \ldots, A_{n}\right\}$; note that $\psi_{n} \circ f$ has positive imaginary part.

Since $\left(g, A_{0}\right)$ can be analytically continued along every curve in the plane and since the plane is simply connected, the monodromy theorem implies that $g$ extends to an entire function. Also, the range of $g$ is in $\Pi^{+}$, hence $(g-i) /(g+i)$ is bounded, hence constant, by Liouville's theorem. This shows that $g$ is constant, and since $\psi_{0}$ was one-to-one on $f\left(A_{0}\right)$ and $A_{0}$ was a nonempty open set, we conclude that $f$ is constant."

$$
\frac{1}{f\left(e^{i \theta}\right)}=\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty} \gamma_{n} e^{i n \theta} \quad \text { with } \quad \sum_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left|\gamma_{n}\right|<\infty

$$
\|f\|=\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left|c_{n}\right|

It is clear that $A$ is a Banach space. In fact, $A$ is isometrically isomorphic to $\ell^{1}$, the space of all complex functions on the integers which are integrable with respect to the counting measure. But $A$ is also a commutative Banach algebra, under pointwise multiplication. For if $g \in A$ and $g\left(e^{i \theta}\right)=\Sigma b_{n} e^{i n \theta}$, then

$$
f\left(e^{i \theta}\right) g\left(e^{i \theta}\right)=\sum_{n}\left(\sum_{k} c_{n-k} b_{k}\right) e^{i n \theta}

$$

Also, the function 1 is the unit of $A$, and $\|1\|=1$.

Put $f_{0}\left(e^{i \theta}\right)=e^{i \theta}$, as before. Then $f_{0} \in A, 1 / f_{0} \in A$, and $\left\|f_{0}^{n}\right\|=1$ for $n=0$, $\pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$ If $h$ is any complex homomorphism of $A$ and $h\left(f_{0}\right)=\lambda$, the fact that $\|h\| \leq 1$ implies that

$$
\left|\lambda^{n}\right|=\left|h\left(f_{0}^{n}\right)\right| \leq\left\|f_{0}^{n}\right\|=1 \quad(n=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots)
$$

Hence $|\lambda|=1$. In other words, to each $h$ corresponds a point $e^{i \alpha} \in T$ such that $h\left(f_{0}\right)=e^{i \alpha}$, so

$$
h\left(f_{0}^{n}\right)=e^{i n \alpha}=f_{0}^{n}\left(e^{i \alpha}\right) \quad(n=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots)
$$

If $f$ is given by (1), then $f=\Sigma c_{n} f_{0}^{n}$. This series converges in $A$; and since $h$ is a continuous linear functional on $A$, we conclude from (7) that

$$
h(f)=f\left(e^{i \alpha}\right) \quad(f \in A)
$$

Our hypothesis that $f$ vanishes at no point of $T$ says therefore that $f$ is not in the kernel of any complex homomorphism of $A$, and now Theorem 18.17 implies that $f$ is invertible in $A$. But this is precisely what the theorem asserts."
14.22,"$A\left(r_{1}, R_{1}\right)$ and $A\left(r_{2}, R_{2}\right)$ are conformally equivalent if and only if $R_{1} / r_{1}=R_{2} / r_{2}$.","Assume $r_{1}=r_{2}=1$, without loss of generality. Put

$$
A_{1}=A\left(1, R_{1}\right), \quad A_{2}=A\left(1, R_{2}\right)

and assume there exists $f \in H\left(A_{1}\right)$ such that $f$ is one-to-one and $f\left(A_{1}\right)=A_{2}$. Let $K$ be the circle with center at 0 and radius $r=\sqrt{R_{2}}$. Since $f^{-1}: A_{2} \rightarrow A_{1}$ is also holomorphic, $f^{-1}(K)$ is compact. Hence

$$
A(1,1+\epsilon) \cap f^{-1}(K)=\varnothing
$$

for some $\epsilon>0$. Then $V=f(A(1,1+\epsilon))$ is a connected subset of $A_{2}$ which does not intersect $K$, so that $V \subset A(1, r)$ or $V \subset A\left(r, R_{2}\right)$. In the latter case, replace $f$ by $R_{2} / f$. So we can assume that $V \subset A(1, r)$. If $1<\left|z_{n}\right|<1+\epsilon$ and $\left|z_{n}\right| \rightarrow 1$, then $f\left(z_{n}\right) \in V$ and $\left\{f\left(z_{n}\right)\right\}$ has no limit point in $A_{2}$ (since $f^{-1}$ is continuous); thus $\left|f\left(z_{n}\right)\right| \rightarrow 1$. In the same manner we see that $\left|f\left(z_{n}\right)\right| \rightarrow R_{2}$ if $\left|z_{n}\right| \rightarrow R_{1}$.

Now define

$$
\alpha=\frac{\log R_{2}}{\log R_{1}}
$$

and

$$
u(z)=2 \log |f(z)|-2 \alpha \log |z| \quad\left(z \in A_{1}\right)
$$

Let $\partial$ be one of the Cauchy-Riemann operators. Since $\partial \bar{f}=0$ and $\partial f=f^{\prime}$, the chain rule gives

$$
\partial(2 \log |f|)=\partial(\log (\overline{f f}))=f^{\prime} / f
$$

so that

$$
(\partial u)(z)=\frac{f^{\prime}(z)}{f(z)}-\frac{\alpha}{z} \quad\left(z \in A_{1}\right)
$$

Thus $u$ is a harmonic function in $A_{1}$ which, by the first paragraph of this proof, extends to a continuous function on $\bar{A}_{1}$ which is 0 on the boundary of $A_{1}$. Since nonconstant harmonic functions have no local maxima or minima, we conclude that $u=0$. Thus

$$
\frac{f^{\prime}(z)}{f(z)}=\frac{\alpha}{z} \quad\left(z \in A_{1}\right)
$$

Put $\gamma(t)=\sqrt{R_{1}} e^{i t}(-\pi \leq t \leq \pi)$; put $\Gamma=f \circ \gamma$. As in the proof of Theorem 10.43, (7) gives

$$
\alpha=\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{\gamma} \frac{f^{\prime}(z)}{f(z)} d z=\operatorname{Ind}_{\Gamma}(0)
$$

Thus $\alpha$ is an integer. By (3), $\alpha>0$. By (7), the derivative of $z^{-\alpha} f(z)$ is 0 in $A_{1}$. Thus $f(z)=c z^{\alpha}$. Since $f$ is one-to-one in $A_{1}, \alpha=1$. Hence $R_{2}=R_{1}$."

$$
\varphi(z)=\frac{f^{\prime}(z)}{f(z)}=\frac{m}{z-a}+\frac{h^{\prime}(z)}{h(z)}

Thus

$$

Let $A=\left\{a \in \Omega_{1}: f(a)=0\right\}$. If our assumptions about the index of $\gamma$ are combined with the residue theorem one obtains

This proves one half of (1). The other half is a matter of direct computation:

Next, (2) shows that $g$ has no zero on $\gamma^{*}$. Hence (1) holds with $g$ in place of $f$. Put $\Gamma_{0}=g \circ \gamma$. Then it follows from (1), (2), and Lemma 10.39 that

14.18 (a),"Let $\Omega$ be a bounded simply connected region in the plane, and let $f$ be a conformal mapping of $\Omega$ onto $U$: If $\beta$ is a simple boundary point of $\Omega$, then $f$ has a continuous extension to $\Omega \cup\{\beta\}$. If $f$ is so extended, then $|f(\beta)|=1$.","Let $g$ be the inverse of $f$. Then $g \in H(U)$, by Theorem 10.33, $g(U)=\Omega$, $g$ is one-to-one, and $g \in H^{\infty}$, since $\Omega$ is bounded.

Suppose $(a)$ is false. Then there is a sequence $\left\{\alpha_{n}\right\}$ in $\Omega$ such that $\alpha_{n} \rightarrow \beta$, $f\left(\alpha_{2 n}\right) \rightarrow w_{1}, f\left(\alpha_{2 n+1}\right) \rightarrow w_{2}$, and $w_{1} \neq w_{2}$. Choose $\gamma$ as in Definition 14.16, and put $\Gamma(t)=f(\gamma(t))$, for $0 \leq t<1$. Put $K_{r}=g(\bar{D}(0 ; r))$, for $0<r<1$. Then $K_{r}$ is a compact subset of $\Omega$. Since $\gamma(t) \rightarrow \beta$ as $t \rightarrow 1$, there exists a $t^{*}<1$ (depending on $r$ ) such that $\gamma(t) \notin K_{r}$ if $t^{*}<t<1$. Thus $|\Gamma(t)|>r$ if $t^{*}<t<1$. This says that $|\Gamma(t)| \rightarrow 1$ as $t \rightarrow 1$. Since $\Gamma\left(t_{2 n}\right) \rightarrow w_{1}$ and $\Gamma\left(t_{2 n+1}\right) \rightarrow w_{2}$, we also have $\left|w_{1}\right|=\left|w_{2}\right|=1$.

It now follows that one of the two open arcs $J$ whose union is $T-\left(\left\{w_{1}\right\} \cup\left\{w_{2}\right\}\right)$ has the property that every radius of $U$ which ends at a point of $J$ intersects the range of $\Gamma$ in a set which has a limit point on $T$. Note that $g(\Gamma(t))=\gamma(t)$ for $0 \leq t<1$ and that $g$ has radial limits a.e. on $T$, since $g \in H^{\infty}$. Hence

$$
\lim _{r \rightarrow 1} g\left(r e^{i t}\right)=\beta \quad(\text { a.e. on } J)
$$

since $g(\Gamma(t)) \rightarrow \beta$ as $t \rightarrow 1$. By Theorem 11.32, applied to $g-\beta$, (1) shows that $g$ is constant. But $g$ is one-to-one in $U$, and we have a contradiction. Thus $w_{1}=w_{2}$, and $(a)$ is proved."

If we multiply $f$ by a suitable constant of absolute value 1 , we then have $\beta_{1} \neq \beta_{2}$ but $f\left(\beta_{1}\right)=f\left(\beta_{2}\right)=1$.

Since $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ are simple boundary points of $\Omega$, there are curves $\gamma_{i}$ with parameter interval $[0,1]$ such that $\gamma_{i}([0,1)) \subset \Omega$ for $i=1$ and 2 and $\gamma_{i}(1)=$ $\beta_{i}$. Put $\Gamma_{i}(t)=f\left(\gamma_{i}(t)\right)$. Then $\Gamma_{i}([0,1)) \subset U$, and $\Gamma_{1}(1)=\Gamma_{2}(1)=1$. Since $g\left(\Gamma_{i}(t)\right)=\gamma_{i}(t)$ on $[0,1)$, we have

$$
\lim _{t \rightarrow 1} g\left(\Gamma_{i}(t)\right)=\beta_{i} \quad(i=1,2)

Theorem 12.10 implies therefore that the radial limit of $g$ at 1 is $\beta_{1}$ as well as $\beta_{2}$. This is impossible if $\beta_{1} \neq \beta_{2}$."
12.13,"Suppose $M$ is a vector space of continuous complex functions on the closed unit disc $\bar{U}$, with the following properties:

(a) $1 \in M$.

(b) If $f \in M$, then also $\bar{f} \in M$.

(c) If $f \in M$, then $\|f\|_{U}=\|f\|_{T}$.

Then every $f \in M$ is holomorphic in $U$.","By $(a)$ and $(b), M$ contains all polynomials. In conjunction with $(c)$, this shows that $M$ satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 5.25. Thus every $f \in M$ is harmonic in $U$. We shall use (b) to show that every $f \in M$ actually satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equation.

Let $\partial$ and $\bar{\partial}$ be the differential operators introduced in Sec. 11.1. The product rule for differentiation gives

$$
(\partial \bar{\partial})(f g)=f \cdot(\partial \bar{\partial} g)+(
\partial f) \cdot(\bar{\partial} g)+(
\bar{\partial} f) \cdot(\partial g)+(

Fix $f \in M$, and take $g=j$. Then $f j \in M$. Hence $f$ and $f j$ are harmonic, so $\partial \bar{\partial} f=0$ and $(\partial \bar{\partial})(f j)=0$. Also, $\bar{\partial} j=0$ and $\partial j=1$. The above identity therefore reduces to $\bar{\partial} f=0$. Thus $f \in H(U)$."
12.14,"Rad\'o's Theorem: Assume $f \in C(\bar{U}), \Omega$ is the set of all $z \in U$ at which $f(z) \neq 0$, and $f$ is holomorphic in $\Omega$.

If not, there exist $\alpha \in \Omega$ and $\beta \in U-\bar{\Omega}$ such that $2|\beta-\alpha|<1-|\beta|$. Choose $n$ so that $2^{n}|f(\alpha)|>\|f\|_{T}$. Define $h(z)=(z-\beta)^{-n} f(z)$, for $z \in \bar{\Omega}$. If $z \in U \cap \partial \Omega$, then $f(z)=0$, hence $h(z)=0$. If $z \in T \cap \partial \Omega$, then

$$
|h(z)| \leq(1-|\beta|)^{-n}\|f\|_{T}<|\alpha-\beta|^{-n}|f(\alpha)|=|h(\alpha)| .
$$

This contradicts the maximum modulus theorem.

Thus $\Omega$ is dense in $U$.

Next, let $M$ be the vector space of all $g \in C(\bar{U})$ that are holomorphic in $\Omega$. Fix $g \in M$. For $n=1,2,3, \ldots, f g^{n}=0$ on $U \cap \partial \Omega$. The maximum modulus theorem implies therefore, for every $\alpha \in \Omega$, that

$$
|f(\alpha)||g(\alpha)|^{n} \leq\left\|f g^{n}\right\|_{\partial \Omega}=\left\|f g^{n}\right\|_{T} \leq\|f\|_{T}\|g\|_{T}^{n}
$$

If we take $n$th roots and then let $n \rightarrow \infty$, we see that $|g(\alpha)| \leq\|g\|_{T}$, for every $\alpha \in \Omega$. Since $\Omega$ is dense in $U,\|g\|_{U}=\|g\|_{T}$.

It follows that $M$ satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 12.13. Since $f \in M$, $f$ is holomorphic in $U$."
13.11 (a),For a plane region $\Omega$: $\Omega$ is homeomorphic to the open unit disc $U$.,"To say that $\Omega$ is homeomorphic to $U$ means that there is a continuous one-to-one mapping $\psi$ of $\Omega$ onto $U$ whose inverse $\psi^{-1}$ is also continuous.

where $\Gamma(z)$ is any path in $\Omega$ from $z_{0}$ to $z$. This defines a function $F$ in $\Omega$. For if $\Gamma_{1}(z)$ is another path from $z_{0}$ to $z$ (in $\Omega$ ), then $\Gamma$ followed by the opposite of $\Gamma_{1}$ is a closed path in $\Omega$, the integral of $f$ over this closed path is 0 , so (1) is not affected if $\Gamma(z)$ is replaced by $\Gamma_{1}(z)$. We now verify that $F^{\prime}=f$. Fix $a \in \Omega$. There exists an $r>0$ such that $D(a ; r) \subset \Omega$. For $z \in D(a ; r)$ we can compute $F(z)$ by integrating $f$ over a path $\Gamma(a)$, followed by the interval $[a, z]$. Hence, for $z \in D^{\prime}(a ; r)$,

$$
\frac{F(z)-F(a)}{z-a}=\frac{1}{z-a} \int_{[a, z]} f(\zeta) d \zeta

We can add a constant to $g$, so that $\exp \left\{g\left(z_{0}\right)\right\}=f\left(z_{0}\right)$ for some $z_{0} \in \Omega$. Our choice of $g$ shows that the derivative of $f e^{-g}$ is 0 in $\Omega$, hence $f e^{-g}$ is constant (since $\Omega$ is connected), and it follows that $f=e^{g}$."

If $\Omega$ is a proper subregion of the plane which satisfies $(j)$, then there actually exists a holomorphic homeomorphism of $\Omega$ onto $U$ (a conformal mapping). This assertion is the Riemann mapping theorem, which is the main objective of the next chapter. Hence the proof of Theorem 13.11 will be complete as soon as the Riemann mapping theorem is proved.

If $z \in \varphi_{1}(Q) \cap \varphi_{2}(Q)$, then $\varphi_{1}^{-1}(z) \in Q \cap \varphi(Q)$. It is therefore enough to show that

$$
Q \cap \varphi(Q)=\varnothing
$$

if $\varphi \in \Gamma_{1}$ and $\varphi$ is not the identity transformation.

The proof of (3) splits into three cases.

If $c=0$ in (1), then $a d=1$, and since $a$ and $d$ are integers, we have $a=d= \pm 1$. Hence $\varphi(z)=z+2 n$ for some integer $n \neq 0$, and the description of $Q$ makes it evident that (3) holds.

If $c=2 d$, then $c= \pm 2$ and $d= \pm 1$ (since $a d-b c=1$ ). Therefore $\varphi(z)=\sigma(z)+2 m$, where $m$ is an integer. Since $\sigma(Q) \subset \bar{D}\left(\frac{1}{2} ; \frac{1}{2}\right),(3)$ holds.

If $c \neq 0$ and $c \neq 2 d$, we claim that $|c z+d|>1$ for all $z \in Q$. Otherwise, the disc $\bar{D}(-d / c ; 1 /|c|)$ would intersect $Q$. The description of $Q$ shows that if $\alpha \neq-\frac{1}{2}$ is a real number and if $\bar{D}(\alpha ; r)$ intersects $Q$, then at least one of the points $-1,0,1$ lies in $D(\alpha ; r)$. Hence $|c w+d|<1$, for $w=-1$ or 0 or 1 . But for these $w, c w+d$ is an odd integer whose absolute value cannot be less than 1. So $|c z+d|>1$, and it now follows from (2) that $\operatorname{Im} \varphi(z)<\operatorname{Im} z$ for
every $z \in Q$. If it were true for some $z \in Q$ that $\varphi(z) \in Q$, the same argument would apply to $\varphi^{-1}$ and would show that

$$
\operatorname{Im} z=\operatorname{Im} \varphi^{-1}(\varphi(z)) \leq \operatorname{Im} \varphi(z)
$$

This contradiction shows that (3) holds."
16.19 (b),Let $\Gamma$ and $Q$ be as above: $\bigcup_{\varphi \in \Gamma} \varphi(Q)=\Pi^{+}$,"let $\Sigma$ be the union of the sets $\varphi(Q)$, for $\varphi \in \Gamma$. It is clear that $\Sigma \subset \Pi^{+}$. Also, $\Sigma$ contains the sets $\tau^{n}(Q)$, for $n=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$, where $\tau^{n}(z)=z+2 n$. Since $\sigma$ maps the circle $|2 z+1|=1$ onto the circle $|2 z-1|=1$, we see that $\Sigma$ contains every $z \in \Pi^{+}$which satisfies all inequalities

$$
|2 z-(2 m+1)| \geq 1 \quad(m=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots)
$$

Fix $w \in \Pi^{+}$. Since $\operatorname{Im} w>0$, there are only finitely many pairs of integers $c$ and $d$ such that $|c w+d|$ lies below any given bound, and we can choose $\varphi_{0} \in \Gamma$ so that $|c w+d|$ is minimized. By (2), this means that

$$
\operatorname{Im} \varphi(w) \leq \operatorname{Im} \varphi_{0}(w) \quad(\varphi \in \Gamma)
$$

Put $z=\varphi_{0}(w)$. Then (6) becomes

$$
\operatorname{Im} \varphi(z) \leq \operatorname{Im} z \quad(\varphi \in \Gamma)
$$

Apply (7) to $\varphi=\sigma \tau^{-n}$ and to $\varphi=\sigma^{-1} \tau^{-n}$. Since

$$
\left(\sigma \tau^{-n}\right)(z)=\frac{z-2 n}{2 z-4 n+1}, \quad\left(\sigma^{-1} \tau^{-n}\right)(z)=\frac{z-2 n}{-2 z+4 n+1}
$$

it follows from (2) and (7) that

$$
|2 z-4 n+1| \geq 1, \quad|2 z-4 n-1| \geq 1 \quad(n=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots)

Thus $z$ satisfies (5), hence $z \in \Sigma$; and since $w=\varphi_{0}^{-1}(z)$ and $\varphi_{0}^{-1} \in \Gamma$, we have $w \in \Sigma$."

To show that $\Gamma=\Gamma_{1}$, i.e., to prove $(c)$, it is enough to prove that $\left(a^{\prime}\right)$ and $(b)$ hold, where $\left(a^{\prime}\right)$ is the statement obtained from $(a)$ by replacing $\Gamma$ by $\Gamma_{1}$. For if $\left(a^{\prime}\right)$ and $(b)$ hold, it is clear that $\Gamma$ cannot be a proper subset of $\Gamma_{1}$."
17.18,"If $0<p \leq \infty, f \in H^{p}$, and $f$ is not identically 0 , then at almost all points of $T$ we have $f^{*}\left(e^{i \theta}\right) \neq 0$.","If $f^{*}=0$ then $\log \left|f^{*}\right|=-\infty$, and if this happens on a set of positive measure, then

If $\varphi$ is an inner function, then $\left|\varphi^{*}\right|=1$ a.e. The mapping $f \rightarrow \varphi f$ is therefore an isometry of $H^{2}$ into $H^{2}$; being an isometry, its range $\varphi H^{2}$ is a closed subspace of $H^{2}$. [Proof: If $\varphi f_{n} \rightarrow g$ in $H^{2}$, then. $\left\{\varphi f_{n}\right\}$ is a Cauchy sequence, hence so is $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$, hence $f_{n} \rightarrow f \in H^{2}$, so $g=\varphi f \in \varphi H^{2}$.] The $S$-invariance of $\varphi H^{2}$ is also trivial, since $z \cdot \varphi f=\varphi \cdot z f$.

Then $h \in H^{2}$, and since $\left|\varphi^{*}\right|=1$ a.e. on $T, h^{*}$ is real a.e. on $T$. Since $h$ is the Poisson integral of $h^{*}$, it follows that $h$ is real in $U$, hence $h$ is constant. Then $\varphi$ must be constant, and $(b)$ is proved."
17.21 (c),"Every closed S-invariant subspace $Y$ of $H^{2}$, other than $\{0\}$, contains an inner function $\varphi$ such that $Y=\varphi H^{2}$.","Suppose $Y$ is a closed $S$-invariant subspace of $H^{2}$ which does not consist of 0 alone. Then there is a smallest integer $k$ such that $Y$ contains a function $f$ of the form

$$
f(z)=\sum_{n=k}^{\infty} c_{n} z^{n}, \quad c_{k}=1
$$

Then $f \notin z Y$, where we write $z Y$ for the set of all $g$ of the form $g(z)=z f(z), f \in Y$. It follows that $z Y$ is a proper closed subspace of $Y$ [closed by the argument used in the proof of $(a)$ ], so $Y$ contains a nonzero vector which is orthogonal to $z Y$ (Theorem 4.11).

So there exists a $\varphi \in Y$ such that $\|\varphi\|_{2}=1$ and $\varphi \perp z Y$. Then $\varphi \perp z^{n} \varphi$, for $n=1,2,3, \ldots$ By the definition of the inner product in $H^{2}$ [see 17.20(6)] this means that

$$
\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\left|\varphi^{*}\left(e^{i \theta}\right)\right|^{2} e^{-i n \theta} d \theta=0 \quad(n=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

These equations are preserved if we replace the left sides by their complex conjugates, i.e., if we replace $n$ by $-n$. Thus all Fourier coefficients of the function $\left|\varphi^{*}\right|^{2} \in L^{1}(T)$ are 0 , except the one corresponding to $n=0$, which is 1. Since $L^{1}$-functions are determined by their Fourier coefficients (Theorem 5.15), it follows that $\left|\varphi^{*}\right|=1$ a.e. on $T$. But $\varphi \in H^{2}$, so $\varphi$ is the Poisson integral of $\varphi^{*}$, and hence $|\varphi| \leq 1$. We conclude that $\varphi$ is an inner function.

Since $\varphi \in Y$ and $Y$ is $S$-invariant, we have $\varphi z^{n} \in Y$ for all $n \geq 0$, hence $\varphi P \in Y$ for every polynomial $P$. The polynomials are dense in $H^{2}$ (the partial sums of the power series of any $f \in H^{2}$ converge to $f$ in the $H^{2}$-norm, by Parseval's theorem), and since $Y$ is closed and $|\varphi| \leq 1$, it follows that $\varphi H^{2} \subset Y$. We have to prove that this inclusion is not proper. Since $\varphi H^{2}$ is closed, it is enough to show that the assumptions $h \in Y$ and $h \perp \varphi H^{2}$ imply $h=0$.

If $h \perp \varphi H^{2}$, then $h \perp \varphi z^{n}$ for $n=0,1,2, \ldots$, or

$$
\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} h^{*}\left(e^{i \theta}\right) \overline{\varphi^{*}\left(e^{i \theta}\right)} e^{-i n \theta} d \theta=0 \quad(n=0,1,2, \ldots)
$$

If $h \in Y$, then $z^{n} h \in z Y$ if $n=1,2,3, \ldots$, and our choice of $\varphi$ shows that $z^{n} h \perp \varphi$, or

$$
\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} h^{*}\left(e^{i \theta}\right) \overline{\varphi^{*}\left(e^{i \theta}\right)} e^{-i n \theta} d \theta=0 \quad(n=-1,-2,-3, \ldots)
$$

Thus all Fourier coefficients of $h^{*} \overline{\varphi^{*}}$ are 0 , hence $h^{*} \overline{\varphi^{*}}=0$ a.e. on $T$; and since $\left|\varphi^{*}\right|=1$ a.e., we have $h^{*}=0$ a.e. Therefore $h=0$, and the proof is complete."

The first of these equalities follows from (2), since $h=\gamma \dot{+} f$. The second holds because $z$ and $w$ lie in $D(a ; r)$, a connected set which does not intersect $h^{*}$.

Thus $\left\{f\left(x_{n}\right)\right\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $Y$. Since $f$ is an isometry on $X_{0}$, it follows that $\left\{x_{n}\right\}$ is also a Cauchy sequence.

is continuous in $\Omega \times \Omega$ (Lemma 10.29). Hence we can define

$$
h(z)=\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{\Gamma} g(z, w) d w \quad(z \in \Omega)
$$

For $z \in \Omega-\Gamma^{*}$, the Cauchy formula (2) is clearly equivalent to the assertion that

$$
h(z)=0 \text {. }
$$

To prove (8), let us first prove that $h \in H(\Omega)$. Note that $g$ is uniformly continuous on every compact subset of $\Omega \times \Omega$. If $z \in \Omega, z_{n} \in \Omega$, and $z_{n} \rightarrow z$, it follows that $g\left(z_{n}, w\right) \rightarrow g(z, w)$ uniformly for $w \in \Gamma^{*}$ (a compact subset of $\Omega$ ). Hence $h\left(z_{n}\right) \rightarrow h(z)$. This proves that $h$ is continuous in $\Omega$. Let $\Delta$ be a closed triangle in $\Omega$. Then

$$
\int_{\partial \Delta} h(z) d z=\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{\Gamma}\left(\int_{\partial \Delta} g(z, w) d z\right) d w
$$

For each $w \in \Omega, z \rightarrow g(z, w)$ is holomorphic in $\Omega$. (The singularity at $z=w$ is removable.) The inner integral on the right side of (9) is therefore 0 for every $w \in \Gamma^{*}$. Morera's theorem shows now that $h \in H(\Omega)$.

Next, we let $\Omega_{1}$ be the set of all complex numbers $z$ for which $\operatorname{Ind}_{\Gamma}(z)=$ 0 , and we define

$$
h_{1}(z)=\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{\Gamma} \frac{f(w)}{w-z} d w \quad\left(z \in \Omega_{1}\right)
$$

If $z \in \Omega \cap \Omega_{1}$, the definition of $\Omega_{1}$ makes it clear that $h_{1}(z)=h(z)$. Hence there is a function $\varphi \in H\left(\Omega \cup \Omega_{1}\right)$ whose restriction to $\Omega$ is $h$ and whose restriction to $\Omega_{1}$ is $h_{1}$.

Our hypothesis (1) shows that $\Omega_{1}$ contains the complement of $\Omega$. Thus $\varphi$ is an entire function. $\Omega_{1}$ also contains the unbounded component of the complement of $\Gamma^{*}$, since $\operatorname{Ind}_{\Gamma}(z)$ is 0 there. Hence

$$
\lim _{|z| \rightarrow \infty} \varphi(z)=\lim _{|z| \rightarrow \infty} h_{1}(z)=0
$$

Liouville's theorem implies now that $\varphi(z)=0$ for every $z$. This proves (8), and hence (2).

To deduce (3) from (2), pick $a \in \Omega-\Gamma^{*}$ and define $F(z)=(z-a) f(z)$. Then

$$
\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{\Gamma} f(z) d z=\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{\Gamma} \frac{F(z)}{z-a} d z=F(a) \cdot \operatorname{Ind}_{\Gamma}(a)=0
$$

because $F(a)=0$.

Finally, (5) follows from (4) if (3) is applied to the cycle $\Gamma=\Gamma_{1}-\Gamma_{0}$. This completes the proof."
20.5,"If $K$ is a compact set in the plane whose complement is connected, if $f$ is a continuous complex function on $K$ which is holomorphic in the interior of $K$, and if $\epsilon>0$, then there exists a polynomial $P$ such that $|f(z)-P(z)|<\epsilon$ for all $z \in K$.","By Tietze's theorem, $f$ can be extended to a continuous function in the plane, with compact support. We fix one such extension, and denote it again by $f$.

For any $\delta>0$, let $\omega(\delta)$ be the supremum of the numbers

$$
\left|f\left(z_{2}\right)-f\left(z_{1}\right)\right|
$$

where $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ are subject to the condition $\left|z_{2}-z_{1}\right| \leq \delta$. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous, we have

$$
\lim _{\delta \rightarrow 0} \omega(\delta)=0
$$

From now on, $\delta$ will be fixed. We shall prove that there is a polynomial $P$ such that

$$
|f(z)-P(z)|<10,000 \omega(\delta) \quad(z \in K)
$$

By (1), this proves the theorem.

Our first objective is the construction of a function $\Phi \in C_{c}^{\prime}\left(R^{2}\right)$, such that for all $z$

$$
\begin{aligned}
|f(z)-\Phi(z)| & \leq \omega(\delta) \\
|\left(\bar{\partial} \Phi\right)(z)| & <\frac{2 \omega(\delta)}{\delta}
\end{aligned}
$$

and

$$
\Phi(z)=-\frac{1}{\pi} \iint_{X} \frac{\left(\bar{\partial} \Phi\right)(\zeta)}{\zeta-z} d \xi d \eta \quad(\zeta=\xi+i \eta)
$$

where $X$ is the set of all points in the support of $\Phi$ whose distance from the complement of $K$ does not exceed $\delta$. (Thus $X$ contains no point which is ""far within"" $K$.)

We construct $\Phi$ as the convolution of $f$ with a smoothing function $A$. Put $a(r)=0$ if $r>\delta$, put

$$
a(r)=\frac{3}{\pi \delta^{2}}\left(1-\frac{r^{2}}{\delta^{2}}\right)^{2} \quad(0 \leq r \leq \delta)
$$

and define

$$
A(z)=a(|z|)
$$

for all complex $z$. It is clear that $A \in C_{c}^{\prime}\left(R^{2}\right)$. We claim that

$$
\begin{gathered}
\iint_{R^{2}} A=1, \\
\iint_{R^{2}} \bar{\partial} A=0, \\
\iint_{R^{2}}|\bar{\partial} A|=\frac{24}{15 \delta}<\frac{2}{\delta} .
\end{gathered}
$$

The constants are so adjusted in (6) that (8) holds. (Compute the integral in polar coordinates.) (9) holds simply because $A$ has compact support. To compute (10), express $\bar{\partial} A$ in polar coordinates, as in the proof of Lemma 20.3, and note that $\partial A / \partial \theta=0,|\partial A / \partial r|=-a^{\prime}(r)$.

Now define

$$
\Phi(z)=\iint_{R^{2}} f(z-\zeta) A(\zeta) d \xi d \eta=\iint_{R^{2}} A(z-\zeta) f(\zeta) d \xi d \eta
$$

Since $f$ and $A$ have compact support, so does $\Phi$. Since

$$
\Phi(z)-f(z)=\iint_{R^{2}}[f(z-\zeta)-f(z)] A(\zeta) d \xi d \eta
$$

and $A(\zeta)=0$ if $|\zeta|>\delta$, (3) follows from (8). The difference quotients of $A$ converge boundedly to the corresponding partial derivatives of $A$, since
$A \in C_{c}^{\prime}\left(R^{2}\right)$. Hence the last expression in (11) may be differentiated under the integral sign, and we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\bar{\partial} \Phi)(z) & =\iint_{R^{2}}(\bar{\partial} A)(z-\zeta) f(\zeta) d \xi d \eta \\
& =\iint_{R^{2}} f(z-\zeta)(\bar{\partial} A)(\zeta) d \xi d \eta \\
& =\iint_{R^{2}}[f(z-\zeta)-f(z)](\bar{\partial} A)(\zeta) d \xi d \eta
\end{aligned}
$$

The last equality depends on (9). Now (10) and (13) give (4). If we write (13) with $\Phi_{x}$ and $\Phi_{y}$ in place of $\bar{\partial} \Phi$, we see that $\Phi$ has continuous partial derivatives. Hence Lemma 20.3 applies to $\Phi$, and (5) will follow if we can show that $\bar{\partial} \Phi=0$ in $G$, where $G$ is the set of all $z \in K$ whose distance from the complement of $K$ exceeds $\delta$. We shall do this by showing that

$$
\Phi(z)=f(z) \quad(z \in G)
$$

note that $\bar{\partial} f=0$ in $G$, since $f$ is holomorphic there. (We recall that $\bar{\partial}$ is the Cauchy-Riemann operator defined in Sec. 11.1.) Now if $z \in G$, then $z-\zeta$ is in the interior of $K$ for all $\zeta$ with $|\zeta|<\delta$. The mean value property for harmonic functions therefore gives, by the first equation in (11),

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Phi(z) & =\int_{0}^{\delta} a(r) r d r \int_{0}^{2 \pi} f\left(z-r e^{i \theta}\right) d \theta \\
& =2 \pi f(z) \int_{0}^{\delta} a(r) r d r=f(z) \iint_{R^{2}} A=f(z)
\end{aligned}
$$

for all $z \in G$.

We have now proved (3), (4), and (5).

The definition of $X$ shows that $X$ is compact and that $X$ can be covered by finitely many open discs $D_{1}, \ldots, D_{n}$, of radius $2 \delta$, whose centers are not in $K$. Since $S^{2}-K$ is connected, the center of each $D_{j}$ can be joined to $\infty$ by a polygonal path in $S^{2}-K$. It follows that each $D_{j}$ contains a compact connected set $E_{j}$, of diameter at least $2 \delta$, so that $S^{2}-E_{j}$ is connected and so that $K \cap E_{j}=\varnothing$.

We now apply Lemma 20.2, with $r=2 \delta$. There exist functions
$g_{j} \in H\left(S^{2}-E_{j}\right)$ and constants $b_{j}$ so that the inequalities

$$
\begin{gathered}
\left|Q_{\jmath}(\zeta, z)\right|<\frac{50}{\delta}, \\
\left|Q_{j}(\zeta, z)-\frac{1}{z-\zeta}\right|<\frac{4,000 \delta^{2}}{|z-\zeta|^{3}}
\end{gathered}
$$

hold for $z \notin E_{j}$ and $\zeta \in D_{j}$, if

$$
Q_{j}(\zeta, z)=g_{j}(z)+\left(\zeta-b_{j}\right) g_{j}^{2}(z)
$$

Let $\Omega$ be the complement of $E_{1} \cup \cdots \cup E_{n}$. Then $\Omega$ is an open set which contains $K$.

Put $\quad X_{1}=X \cap D_{1} \quad$ and $\quad X_{j}=\left(X \cap D_{j}\right)-\left(X_{1} \cup \cdots \cup X_{j-1}\right), \quad$ for $2 \leq j \leq n$. Define

$$
R(\zeta, z)=Q_{j}(\zeta, z) \quad\left(\zeta \in X_{j}, z \in \Omega\right)
$$

and

$$
F(z)=\frac{1}{\pi} \iint_{X}(\bar{\partial} \Phi)(\zeta) R(\zeta, z) d \xi d \eta \quad(z \in \Omega)
$$

Since

$$
F(z)=\sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\pi} \iint_{X_{j}}(\bar{\partial} \Phi)(\zeta) Q_{j}(\zeta, z) d \xi d \eta
$$

(18) shows that $F$ is a finite linear combination of the functions $g_{j}$ and $g_{j}^{2}$. Hence $F \in H(\Omega)$.

By (20), (4), and (5) we have

$$
|F(z)-\Phi(z)|<\frac{2 \omega(\delta)}{\pi \delta} \iint_{X}\left|R(\zeta, z)-\frac{1}{z-\zeta}\right| d \xi d \eta \quad(z \in \Omega)
$$

Observe that the inequalities (16) and (17) are valid with $R$ in place of $Q_{j}$ if $\zeta \in X$ and $z \in \Omega$. For if $\zeta \in X$ then $\zeta \in X_{j}$ for some $j$, and then $R(\zeta, z)=$ $Q_{f}(\zeta, z)$ for all $z \in \Omega$.

Now fix $z \in \Omega$, put $\zeta=z+\rho e^{i \theta}$, and estimate the integrand in (22) by (16) if $\rho<4 \delta$, by (17) if $4 \delta \leq \rho$. The integral in (22) is then seen to be less than the sum of

$$
2 \pi \int_{0}^{4 \delta}\left(\frac{50}{\delta}+\frac{1}{\rho}\right) \rho d \rho=808 \pi \delta
$$

and

$$
2 \pi \int_{4 \delta}^{\infty} \frac{4,000 \delta^{2}}{\rho^{3}} \rho d \rho=2,000 \pi \delta
$$

Hence (22) yields

$$
|F(z)-\Phi(z)|<6,000 \omega(\delta) \quad(z \in \Omega)
$$

Since $F \in H(\Omega), K \subset \Omega$, and $S^{2}-K$ is connected, Runge's theorem shows that $F$ can be uniformly approximated on $K$ by polynomials. Hence (3) and (25) show that (2) can be satisfied.

This completes the proof."
3.9,"Suppose $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, and $f \in L^{p}(\mu), g \in L^{p}(\mu)$. Then $f+g \in L^{p}(\mu)$, and

$$
\|f+g\|_{p} \leq\|f\|_{p}+\|g\|_{p} .
$$","For $1<p<\infty$, this follows from Minkowski's inequality, since

$$
\int_{X}|f+g|^{p} d \mu \leq \int_{X}(|f|+|g|)^{p} d \mu .

For $p=1$ or $p=\infty$, (1) is a trivial consequence of the inequality $|f+g| \leq|f|+|g|$."
3.10,"Fix $p, 1 \leq p \leq \infty$. If $f \in L^{p}(\mu)$ and $\alpha$ is a complex number, it is clear that $\alpha f \in L^{p}(\mu)$. In fact,

$$
\|\alpha f\|_{p}=|\alpha|\|f\|_{p}
$$
In conjunction with Theorem 3.9, this shows that $L^{p}(\mu)$ is a complex vector space.

Suppose $f, g$, and $h$ are in $L^{p}(\mu)$. Replacing $f$ by $f-g$ and $g$ by $g-h$ in Theorem 3.9, we obtain

$$
\|f-h\|_{p} \leq\|f-g\|_{p}+\|g-h\|_{p} .
$$
This suggests that a metric may be introduced in $L^{p}(\mu)$ by defining the distance between $f$ and $g$ to be $\|f-g\|_{p}$. Call this distance $d(f, g)$ for the moment. Then $0 \leq d(f, g)<\infty, d(f, f)=0, d(f, g)=d(g, f)$, and (2) shows that the triangle inequality $d(f, h) \leq d(f, g)+d(g, h)$ is satisfied. The only other property which $d$ should have to define a metric space is that $d(f, g)=0$ should imply that $f=g$. In our present situation this need not be so; we have $d(f, g)=0$ precisely when $f(x)=g(x)$ for almost all $x$.

Let us write $f \sim g$ if and only if $d(f, g)=0$. It is clear that this is an equivalence relation in $L^{p}(\mu)$ which partitions $L^{p}(\mu)$ into equivalence classes; each class consists of all functions which are equivalent to a given one. If $F$ and $G$ are two equivalence classes, choose $f \in F$ and $g \in G$, and define $d(F, G)=d(f, g)$; note that $f \sim f_{1}$ and $g \sim g_{1}$ implies

$$
d(f, g)=d\left(f_{1}, g_{1}\right)
$$
so that $d(F, G)$ is well defined.

With this definition, the set of equivalence classes is now a metric space. Note that it is also a vector space, since $f \sim f_{1}$ and $g \sim g_{1}$ implies $f+g \sim$ $f_{1}+g_{1}$ and $\alpha f \sim \alpha f_{1}$.

When $L^{p}(\mu)$ is regarded as a metric space, then the space which is really under consideration is therefore not a space whose elements are functions, but a space whose elements are equivalence classes of functions. For the sake of simplicity of language, it is, however, customary to relegate this distinction to the status of a tacit understanding and to continue to speak of $L^{p}(\mu)$ as a space of functions. We shall follow this custom.

If $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ is a sequence in $L^{p}(\mu)$, if $f \in L^{p}(\mu)$, and if $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left\|f_{n}-f\right\|_{p}=0$, we say that $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ converges to $f$ in $L^{p}(\mu)$ (or that $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ converges to $f$ in the mean of order $p$, or that $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ is $L^{p}$-convergent to $f$ ). If to every $\epsilon>0$ there corresponds an integer $N$ such that $\left\|f_{n}-f_{m}\right\|_{p}<\epsilon$ as soon as $n>N$ and $m>N$, we call $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ a Cauchy sequence in $L^{p}(\mu)$. These definitions are exactly as in any metric space.

It is a very important fact that $L^{p}(\mu)$ is a complete metric space, i.e., that every Cauchy sequence in $L^{p}(\mu)$ converges to an element of $L^{p}(\mu)$ :","Error, no proof value given."

S(x, r)=\{y \in X: \rho(x, y)<r\}
$$

and let $\bar{S}(x, r)$ be the closure of $S(x, r)$. [Note: There exist situations in which $\bar{S}(x, r)$ does not contain all $y$ with $\rho(x, y) \leq r !]$

Since $V_{1}$ is dense, $W \cap V_{1}$ is a nonempty open set, and we can therefore find $x_{1}$ and $r_{1}$ such that

$$
\bar{S}\left(x_{1}, r_{1}\right) \subset W \cap V_{1} \quad \text { and } \quad 0<r_{1}<1

If $n \geq 2$ and $x_{n-1}$ and $r_{n-1}$ are chosen, the denseness of $V_{n}$ shows that $V_{n} \cap$ $S\left(x_{n-1}, r_{n-1}\right)$ is not empty, and we can therefore find $x_{n}$ and $r_{n}$ such that

By induction, this process produces a sequence $\left\{x_{n}\right\}$ in $X$.

\left\|\Lambda_{\alpha}\left(x_{0}+x\right)\right\| \leq N
$$

for all $\alpha \in A$ and all $x$ with $\|x\| \leq r$. Since $x=\left(x_{0}+x\right)-x_{0}$, we then have

$$
\left\|\Lambda_{\alpha} x\right\| \leq\left\|\Lambda_{\alpha}\left(x_{0}+x\right)\right\|+\left\|\Lambda_{\alpha} x_{0}\right\| \leq 2 N
$$

and it follows that (1) holds with $M=2 N / r$.

The other possibility is that every $V_{n}$ is dense in $X$. In that case, $\cap V_{n}$ is a dense $G_{\delta}$ in $X$, by Baire's theorem; and since $\varphi(x)=\infty$ for every $x \in \bigcap V_{n}$, the proof is complete."
5.9,"Let $U$ and $V$ be the open unit balls of the Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$. To every bounded linear transformation $\Lambda$ of $X$ onto $Y$ there corresponds a $\delta>0$ so that

$$
\Lambda(U) \supset \delta V
$$","Given $y \in Y$, there exists an $x \in X$ such that $\Lambda x=y$; if $\|x\|<k$, it follows that $y \in \Lambda(k U)$. Hence $Y$ is the union of the sets $\Lambda(k U)$, for $k=1,2,3, \ldots$. Since $Y$ is complete, the Baire theorem implies that there is a nonempty open set $W$ in the closure of some $\Lambda(k U)$. This means that every point of $W$ is the limit of a sequence $\left\{\Lambda x_{i}\right\}$, where $x_{i} \in k U$; from now on, $k$ and $W$ are fixed.

Choose $y_{0} \in W$, and choose $\eta>0$ so that $y_{0}+y \in W$ if $\|y\|<\eta$. For any such $y$ there are sequences $\left\{x_{i}^{\prime}\right\},\left\{x_{i}^{\prime \prime}\right\}$ in $k U$ such that

$$
\Lambda x_{i}^{\prime} \rightarrow y_{0}, \quad \Lambda x_{i}^{\prime \prime} \rightarrow y_{0}+y \quad(i \rightarrow \infty)
$$

Setting $x_{i}=x_{i}^{\prime \prime}-x_{i}^{\prime}$, we have $\left\|x_{i}\right\|<2 k$ and $\Lambda x_{i} \rightarrow y$. Since this holds for every $y$ with $\|y\|<\eta$, the linearity of $\Lambda$ shows that the following is true, if $\delta=\eta / 2 k$ :

To each $y \in Y$ and to each $\epsilon>0$ there corresponds an $x \in X$ such that

$$
\|x\| \leq \delta^{-1}\|y\| \quad \text { and } \quad\|y-\Lambda x\|<\epsilon .
$$

This is almost the desired conclusion, as stated just before the start of the proof, except that there we had $\epsilon=0$.

Fix $y \in \delta V$, and fix $\epsilon>0$. By (3) there exists an $x_{1}$ with $\left\|x_{1}\right\|<1$ and

$$
\left\|y-\Lambda x_{1}\right\|<\frac{1}{2} \delta \epsilon \text {. }
$$

Suppose $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}$ are chosen so that

$$
\left\|y-\Lambda x_{1}-\cdots-\Lambda x_{n}\right\|<2^{-n} \delta \epsilon .
$$

Use (3), with $y$ replaced by the vector on the left side of (5), to obtain an $x_{n+1}$ so that (5) holds with $n+1$ in place of $n$, and

$$
\left\|x_{n+1}\right\|<2^{-n} \epsilon \quad(n=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

If we set $s_{n}=x_{1}+\cdots+x_{n}$, (6) shows that $\left\{s_{n}\right\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $X$. Since $X$ is complete, there exists an $x \in X$ so that $s_{n} \rightarrow x$. The inequality $\left\|x_{1}\right\|<1$, together with (6), shows that $\|x\|<1+\epsilon$. Since $\Lambda$ is continuous, $\Lambda s_{n} \rightarrow \Lambda x$. By (5), $\Lambda s_{n} \rightarrow y$. Hence $\Lambda x=y$.

We have now proved that

$$
\Lambda((1+\epsilon) U) \supset \delta V
$$

or

$$
\Lambda(U) \supset(1+\epsilon)^{-1} \delta V
$$

for every $\epsilon>0$. The union of the sets on the right of (8), taken over all $\epsilon>0$, is $\delta V$. This proves (1)."
19.11,"Suppose $M_{0}=1, M_{n}^{2} \leq M_{n-1} M_{n+1}$ for $n=1,2,3, \ldots$, and

$$
Q(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{n}}{M_{n}}, \quad q(x)=\sup _{n \geq 0} \frac{x^{n}}{M_{n}}
$$

for $x>0$. Then each of the following five conditions implies the other four:

(a) $C\left\{M_{n}\right\}$ is not quasi-analytic.

(b) $\int_{0}^{\infty} \log Q(x) \frac{d x}{1+x^{2}}<\infty$.

(c) $\int_{0}^{\infty} \log q(x) \frac{d x}{1+x^{2}}<\infty$.

(d) $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{M_{n}}\right)^{1 / n}<\infty$.

(e) $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{M_{n-1}}{M_{n}}<\infty$.

Note: If $M_{n} \rightarrow \infty$ very rapidly as $n \rightarrow \infty$, then $Q(x)$ tends to infinity slowly as $x \rightarrow \infty$. Thus each of the five conditions says, in its own way, that $M_{n} \rightarrow \infty$ rapidly. Note also that $Q(x) \geq 1$ and $q(x) \geq 1$. The integrals in $(b)$ and $(c)$ are thus always defined. It may happen that $Q(x)=\infty$ for some $x<\infty$. In that case, the integral $(b)$ is $+\infty$, and the theorem asserts that $C\left\{M_{n}\right\}$ is quasi-analytic.","Assume that $C\left\{M_{n}\right\}$ is not quasi-analytic. Then $C\left\{M_{n}\right\}$ contains a nontrivial function with compact support (Theorem 19.10). An affine change of variable gives a function $F \in C\left\{M_{n}\right\}$, with support in some interval $[0, A]$, such that

$$
\left\|D^{n} F\right\|_{\infty} \leq 2^{-n} M_{n} \quad(n=0,1,2, \ldots)
$$

and such that $F$ is not identically zero. Define

$$
f(z)=\int_{0}^{A} F(t) e^{i t z} d t
$$

and

$$
g(w)=f\left(\frac{i-i w}{1+w}\right)
$$

Then $f$ is entire. If $\operatorname{Im} z>0$, the absolute value of the integrand in (2) is at most $|F(t)|$. Hence $f$ is bounded in the upper half plane; therefore $g$ is bounded in $U$. Also, $g$ is continuous on $\bar{U}$, except at the point $w=-1$. Since $f$ is not identically 0 (by the uniqueness theorem for Fourier transforms) the same is true of $g$, and now Theorem 15.19 shows that

$$
\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \log \left|g\left(e^{i \theta}\right)\right| d \theta>-\infty
$$

If $x=i\left(1-e^{i \theta}\right) /\left(1+e^{i \theta}\right)=\tan (\theta / 2)$, then $d \theta=2\left(1+x^{2}\right)^{-1} d x$, so (4) is the same as

$$
\frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \log |f(x)| \frac{d x}{1+x^{2}}>\infty
$$

On the other hand, partial integration of (2) gives

$$
f(z)=(i z)^{-n} \int_{0}^{A}\left(D^{n} F\right)(t) e^{i t z} d t \quad(z \neq 0)
$$

since $F$ and all its derivatives vanish at 0 and at $A$. It now follows from (1) and (6) that

$$
\left|x^{n} f(x)\right| \leq 2^{-n} A M_{n} \quad(x \text { real, } n=0,1,2, \ldots)
$$

Hence

$$
Q(x)|f(x)|=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{n}|f(x)|}{M_{n}} \leq 2 A \quad(x \geq 0)
$$

and (5) and (8) imply that (b) holds."
