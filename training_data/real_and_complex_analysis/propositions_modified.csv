5.11,"A Convergence Problem Is it true for every $f \in C(T)$ that the Fourier series of $f$ converges to $f(x)$ at every point $x$ ?

Let us recall that the $n$th partial sum of the Fourier series of $f$ at the point $x$ is given by

$$
s_{n}(f ; x)=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(t) D_{n}(x-t) d t \quad(n=0,1,2, \ldots)
$$

where

$$
D_{n}(t)=\sum_{k=-n}^{n} e^{i k t}
$$

This follows directly from formulas 4.26(1) <$$
\[
\left(x+V_{x}+V_{x}\right) \cap\left(C+V_{x}\right)=\varnothing
\]$$> and 4.26(3) <$$
\[
A(r)=c_{1}(r) V_{1}+c_{2}(r) V_{2}+c_{3}(r) V_{3}+\cdots
\]$$>.

The problem is to determine whether

$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} s_{n}(f ; x)=f(x)
$$

for every $f \in C(T)$ and for every real $x$. We observed in Sec. 4.26 that the partial sums do converge to $f$ in the $L^{2}$-norm, and Theorem 3.12 <>  implies therefore that each $f \in L^{2}(T)$ [hence also each $f \in C(T)$ ] is the pointwise limit a.e. of some subsequence of the full sequence of the partial sums. But this does not answer the present question.

We shall see that the Banach-Steinhaus theorem answers the question negatively. Put

$$
s^{*}(f ; x)=\sup _{n}\left|s_{n}(f ; x)\right| .
$$

To begin with, take $x=0$, and define

$$
\Lambda_{n} f=s_{n}(f ; 0) \quad(f \in C(T) ; n=1,2,3, \ldots)
$$

We know that $C(T)$ is a Banach space, relative to the supremum norm $\|f\|_{\infty}$. It follows from (1) <$$
\[
\left(x+V_{x}+V_{x}\right) \cap\left(C+V_{x}\right)=\varnothing
\]$$> that each $\Lambda_{n}$ is a bounded linear functional on $C(T)$, of norm

$$
\left\|\Lambda_{n}\right\| \leq \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\left|D_{n}(t)\right| d t=\left\|D_{n}\right\|_{1}
$$

We claim that

$$
\left\|\Lambda_{n}\right\| \rightarrow \infty \quad \text { as } n \rightarrow \infty
$$

This will be proved by showing that equality holds in (6) <$$
\[
A(r)+A(s) \subset A(r+s) \quad(r \in D, s \in D) .
\]$$> and that

$$
\left\|D_{n}\right\|_{1} \rightarrow \infty \quad \text { as } n \rightarrow \infty \text {. }
$$
Multiply (2) <$$
\[
r=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_{n}(r) 2^{-n}
\]$$> by $e^{i t / 2}$ and by $e^{-i t / 2}$ and subtract one of the resulting two equations from the other, to obtain

$$
D_{n}(t)=\frac{\sin \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) t}{\sin (t / 2)}
$$
Since $|\sin x| \leq|x|$ for all real $x$, (9) <$$
\[
B_{\delta}=\{x: f(x)<\delta\}=\bigcup_{r<\delta} A(r)
\]$$> shows that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left\|D_{n}\right\|_{1} & >\frac{2}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\pi}\left|\sin \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) t\right| \frac{d t}{t}=\frac{2}{\pi} \int_{0}^{(n+1 / 2) \pi}|\sin t| \frac{d t}{t} \\
& >\frac{2}{\pi} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k \pi} \int_{(k-1) \pi}^{k \pi}|\sin t| d t=\frac{4}{\pi^{2}} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} \rightarrow \infty,
\end{aligned}
$$
which proves (8) <$$ f(x+y) \leq f(x)+f(y) \quad(x \in X, y \in X).$$>.

Next, fix $n$, and put $g(t)=1$ if $D_{n}(t) \geq 0, g(t)=-1$ if $D_{n}(t)<0$. There exist $f_{j} \in C(T)$ such that $-1 \leq f_{j} \leq 1$ and $f_{j}(t) \rightarrow g(t)$ for every $t$, as $j \rightarrow \infty$. By the dominated convergence theorem,

$$
\lim _{j \rightarrow \infty} \Lambda_{n}\left(f_{j}\right)=\lim _{j \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f_{j}(-t) D_{n}(t) d t=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} g(-t) D_{n}(t) d t=\left\|D_{n}\right\|_{1} .
$$
Thus equality holds in (6) <$$
\[
A(r)+A(s) \subset A(r+s) \quad(r \in D, s \in D) .
\]$$>, and we have proved (7) <$$ A(r) \subset A(r)+A(t-r) \subset A(t) \quad if \quad r<t.$$>.

Since (7) <$$ A(r) \subset A(r)+A(t-r) \subset A(t) \quad if \quad r<t.$$> holds, the Banach-Steinhaus theorem asserts now that $s^{*}(f ; 0)=\infty$ for every $f$ in some dense $G_{\delta}$-set in $C(T)$.

We chose $x=0$ just for convenience. It is clear that the same result holds for every other $x$ :

To each real number $x$ there corresponds a set $E_{x} \subset C(T)$ which is a dense $G_{\delta}$ in $C(T)$, such that $s^{*}(f ; x)=\infty$ for every $f \in E_{x}$.

In particular, the Fourier series of each $f \in E_{x}$ diverges at $x$, and we have a negative answer to our question. (Exercise 22 shows the answer is positive if mere continuity is replaced by a somewhat stronger smoothness assumption.)

It is interesting to observe that the above result can be strengthened by another application of Baire's theorem. Let us take countably many points $x_{i}$, and let $E$ be the intersection of the corresponding sets

$$
E_{x_{i}} \subset C(T)
$$
By Baire's theorem, $E$ is a dense $G_{\delta}$ in $C(T)$. Every $f \in E$ has

$$
s^{*}\left(f ; x_{i}\right)=\infty
$$
at every point $x_{i}$.

For each $f, s^{*}(f ; x)$ is a lower semicontinuous function of $x$, since (4) <$$ f(x)=\inf \{r: x \in A(r)\} \quad(x \in X)$$> exhibits it as the supremum of a collection of continuous functions. Hence $\left\{x: s^{*}(f ; x)=\infty\right\}$ is a $G_{\delta}$ in $R^{1}$, for each $f$. If the above points $x_{i}$ are taken so that their union is dense in $(-\pi, \pi)$, we obtain the following result:","Error, no proof value given."

If we wanted to integrate over subsets, we could then use $(f)$ as the definition. It is purely a matter of taste which definition is preferred.

One may also remark here that every measurable subset $E$ of a measure space $X$ is again a measure space, in a perfectly natural way: The new measurable sets are simply those measurable subsets of $X$ which lie in $E$, and the measure is unchanged, except that its domain is restricted.

We have now proved that there exists a norm-preserving extension $f_{1}$ of $f$ on $M_{1}$.

Let $\mathscr{P}$ be the collection of all ordered pairs $\left(M^{\prime}, f^{\prime}\right)$, where $M^{\prime}$ is a subspace of $X$ which contains $M$ and where $f^{\prime}$ is a real-linear extension of $f$ to $M^{\prime}$, with $\left\|f^{\prime}\right\|=1$. Partially order $\mathscr{P}$ by declaring $\left(M^{\prime}, f^{\prime}\right) \leq\left(M^{\prime \prime}, f^{\prime \prime}\right)$ to mean that $M^{\prime} \subset M^{\prime \prime}$ and $f^{\prime \prime}(x)=f^{\prime}(x)$ for all $x \in M^{\prime}$. The axioms of a partial order
are clearly satisfied, $\mathscr{P}$ is not empty since it contains $(M, f)$, and so the Hausdorff maximality theorem asserts the existence of a maximal totally ordered subcollection $\Omega$ of $\mathscr{P}$.

Let $\Phi$ be the collection of all $M^{\prime}$ such that $\left(M^{\prime}, f^{\prime}\right) \in \Omega$. Then $\Phi$ is totally ordered, by set inclusion, and therefore the union $\tilde{M}$ of all members of $\Phi$ is a subspace of $X$. (Note that in general the union of two subspaces is not a subspace. An example is two planes through the origin in $R^{3}$.) If $x \in \tilde{M}$, then $x \in M^{\prime}$ for some $M^{\prime} \in \Phi$; define $F(x)=f^{\prime}(x)$, where $f^{\prime}$ is the function which occurs in the pair $\left(M^{\prime}, f^{\prime}\right) \in \Omega$. Our definition of the partial order in $\Omega$ shows that it is immaterial which $M^{\prime} \in \Phi$ we choose to define $F(x)$, as long as $M^{\prime}$ contains $x$.

It is now easy to check that $F$ is a linear functional on $\tilde{M}$, with $\|F\|=1$. If $\tilde{M}$ were a proper subspace $X$, the first part of the proof would give us a further extension of $F$, and this would contradict the maximality of $\Omega$. Thus $\tilde{M}=X$, and the proof is complete for the case of real scalars.

If now $f$ is a complex-linear functional on the subspace $M$ of the complex normed linear space $X$, let $u$ be the real part of $f$, use the real Hahn-Banach theorem to extend $u$ to a real-linear functional $U$ on $X$, with $\|U\|=\|u\|$, and define

$$
F(x)=U(x)-i U(i x) \quad(x \in X) .
$$

By Proposition 5.17 <> , $F$ is a complex-linear extension of $f$, and

$$
\|F\|=\|U\|=\|u\|=\|f\| .
$$

This completes the proof."
