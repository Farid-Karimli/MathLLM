2.15,"For a measure $\mu$ defined on the $\sigma$-algebra of all Borel sets in a locally compact Hausdorff space $X$: A measure $\mu$ defined on the $\sigma$-algebra of all Borel sets in a locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ is called a Borel measure on $X. If $\mu$ is positive, a Borel set $E \subset X$ is outer regular or inner regular, respectively, if $E$ has property $(c)$ or $(d)$ of Theorem 2.14 <> . If every Borel set in $X$ is both outer and inner regular, $\mu$ is called regular."
3.16,"For a locally compact Hausdorff space $X$: A complex function $f$ on $X$ is said to vanish at infinity if to every $\epsilon>0$ there exists a compact set $K \subset X$ such that $|f(x)|<\epsilon$ for all $x$ not in $K$. The class of all continuous $f$ on $X$ which vanish at infinity is called $C_{0}(X)$. It is clear that $C_{c}(X) \subset C_{0}(X)$, and that the two classes coincide if $X$ is compact. In that case we write $C(X)$ for either of them."
2.16,"A set $E$ in a topological space is called $\sigma$-compact if $E$ is a countable union of compact sets. A set $E$ in a measure space (with measure $\mu$ ) is said to have $\sigma$-finite measure if $E$ is a countable union of sets $E_{i}$ with $\mu\left(E_{i}\right)<\infty$. For example, in the situation described in Theorem 2.14 <> , every $\sigma$ compact set has $\sigma$-finite measure. Also, it is easy to see that if $E \in \mathfrak{M}$ and $E$ has $\sigma$-finite measure, then $E$ is inner regular."
1.30,"We define $L^{1}(\mu)$ to be the collection of all complex measurable functions $f$ on $X$ for which

$$
\int_{X}|f| d \mu<\infty
$$

Note that the measurability of $f$ implies that of $|f|$, as we saw in Proposition $1.9(b)$; hence the above integral is defined.

The members of $L^{1}(\mu)$ are called Lebesgue integrable functions (with respect to $\mu$ ) or summable functions. The significance of the exponent 1 will become clear in Chap. 3."
3.4,"If $p$ and $q$ are positive real numbers such that $p+q=p q$, or equivalently

$$
\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1
$$
then we call $p$ and $q$ a pair of conjugate exponents. It is clear that (1) <$$
\[
\left(x+V_{x}+V_{x}\right) \cap\left(C+V_{x}\right)=\varnothing
\]$$> implies $1<p<\infty$ and $1<q<\infty$. An important special case is $p=q=2$.

As $p \rightarrow 1$, (1) <$$
\[
\left(x+V_{x}+V_{x}\right) \cap\left(C+V_{x}\right)=\varnothing
\]$$> forces $q \rightarrow \infty$. Consequently 1 and $\infty$ are also regarded as a pair of conjugate exponents. Many analysts denote the exponent conjugate to $p$ by $p^{\prime}$, often without saying so explicitly."
4.13 (a),"If $V$ is a vector space, if $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k} \in V$, and if $c_{1}, \ldots, c_{k}$ are scalars, then $c_{1} x_{1}+\cdots+c_{k} x_{k}$ is called a linear combination of $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k}$. The set $\left\{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k}\right\}$ is called independent if $c_{1} x_{1}+\cdots+c_{k} x_{k}=0$ implies that $c_{1}=\cdots=c_{k}=0$. A set $S \subset V$ is independent if every finite subset of $S$ is independent. The set $[S]$ of all linear combinations of all finite subsets of $S$ (also called the set of all finite linear combinations of members of $S$ ) is clearly a vector space; $[S]$ is the smallest subspace of $V$ which contains $S$; $[S]$ is called the span of $S$, or the space spanned by $S$."
6.7,"{'Let $\\mu$ be a positive measure on a $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathfrak{M}$, and let $\\lambda$ be an arbitrary measure on $\\mathfrak{M}$; $\\lambda$ may be positive or complex.

1.16,"For a measurable space $X$: A complex function $s$ on a measurable space $X$ whose range consists of only finitely many points will be called a simple function. Among these are the nonnegative simple functions, whose range is a finite subset of $[0, \infty)$. Note that we explicitly exclude $\infty$ from the values of a simple function.

If $\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}$ are the distinct values of a simple function $s$, and if we set $A_{i}=\left\{x: s(x)=\alpha_{i}\right\}$, then clearly

$$
s=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_{i} \chi_{A_{i}}
$$

where $\chi_{A_{i}}$ is the characteristic function of $A_{i}$, as defined in Sec. 1.9(d).

It is also clear that $s$ is measurable if and only if each of the sets $A_{i}$ is measurable."
1.31,"If $f=u+i v$, where $u$ and $v$ are real measurable functions on $X$, and if $f \in L^{1}(\mu)$, we define

$$

for every measurable set $E$.

Here $u^{+}$and $u^{-}$are the positive and negative parts of $u$, as defined in Sec. $1.15 ; v^{+}$and $v^{-}$are similarly obtained from $v$. These four functions are measurable, real, and nonnegative; hence the four integrals on the right of (1) <$$
\[
\left(x+V_{x}+V_{x}\right) \cap\left(C+V_{x}\right)=\varnothing

each of these four integrals is finite. Thus (1) <$$
\[
\left(x+V_{x}+V_{x}\right) \cap\left(C+V_{x}\right)=\varnothing
\]$$> defines the integral on the left as a complex number.

Occasionally it is desirable to define the integral of a measurable function $f$ with range in $[-\infty, \infty]$ to be

$$
\int_{E} f d \mu=\int_{E} f^{+} d \mu-\int_{E} f^{-} d \mu

3.1,"A real function $\varphi$ defined on a segment $(a, b)$, where $-\infty \leq a<b \leq \infty$, is called convex if the inequality

$$
\varphi((1-\lambda) x+\lambda y) \leq(1-\lambda) \varphi(x)+\lambda \varphi(y)
$$

holds whenever $a<x<b, a<y<b$, and $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$.

Graphically, the condition is that if $x<t<y$, then the point $(t, \varphi(t))$ should lie below or on the line connecting the points $(x, \varphi(x))$ and $(y, \varphi(y))$ in the plane. Also, (1) <$$
\[

whenever $a<s<t<u<b$.

The mean value theorem for differentiation, combined with (2) <$$
\[
r=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_{n}(r) 2^{-n}
\]$$>, shows immediately that a real differentiable function $\varphi$ is convex in $(a, b)$ if and only if $a<s<t<b$ implies $\varphi^{\prime}(s) \leq \varphi^{\prime}(t)$, i.e., if and only if the derivative $\varphi^{\prime}$ is a monotonically increasing function.

For example, the exponential function is convex on $(-\infty, \infty)$. "

If

f(x)=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} f_{n}(x),

3.6,"For $0<p<\infty$ and a complex measurable function $f$ on $X$: Define

\|f\|_{p}=\left\{\int_{X}|f|^{p} d \mu\right\}^{1 / p}

and let $L^{p}(\mu)$ consist of all $f$ for which

$$
\|f\|_{p}<\infty

We call $\|f\|_{p}$ the $L^{p}$-norm of $f$.

If $\mu$ is Lebesgue measure on $R^{k}$, we write $L^{p}\left(R^{k}\right)$ instead of $L^{p}(\mu)$, as in Sec. 2.21. If $\mu$ is the counting measure on a set $A$, it is customary to denote the corresponding $L^{p}$-space by $\ell^{p}(A)$, or simply by $\ell^{p}$, if $A$ is countable. An element of $\ell^{p}$ may be regarded as a complex sequence $x=\left\{\xi_{n}\right\}$, and

$$
\|x\|_{p}=\left\{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|\xi_{n}\right|^{p}\right\}^{1 / p}

3.7,"Suppose $g: X \rightarrow[0, \infty]$ is measurable. Let $S$ be the set of all real $\alpha$ such that

$$
\mu\left(g^{-1}((\alpha, \infty])\right)=0
$$

If $S=\varnothing$, put $\beta=\infty$. If $S \neq \varnothing$, put $\beta=\inf S$. Since

$$
g^{-1}((\beta, \infty])=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} g^{-1}\left((\beta+\frac{1}{n}, \infty\right]\right)
$$

and since the union of a countable collection of sets of measure 0 has measure 0 , we see that $\beta \in S$. We call $\beta$ the essential supremum of $g$.

If $f$ is a complex measurable function on $X$, we define $\|f\|_{\infty}$ to be the essential supremum of $|f|$, and we let $L^{\infty}(\mu)$ consist of all $f$ for which $\|f\|_{\infty}<\infty$. The members of $L^{\infty}(\mu)$ are sometimes called essentially bounded measurable functions on $X$.

It follows from this definition that the inequality $|f(x)| \leq \lambda$ holds for almost all $x$ if and only if $\lambda \geq\|f\|_{\infty}$.

As in Definition 3.6 <> , $L^{\infty}\left(R^{k}\right)$ denotes the class of all essentially bounded (with respect to Lebesgue measure) functions on $R^{k}$, and $\ell^{\infty}(A)$ is the class of all bounded functions on $A$. (Here bounded means the same as essentially bounded, since every nonempty set has positive measure!)"
4.4,"It follows from the triangle inequality that

$$
\|x-z\| \leq\|x-y\|+\|y-z\| \quad(x, y, z \in H) .
$$

If we define the distance between $x$ and $y$ to be $\|x-y\|$, all the axioms for a metric space are satisfied; here, for the first time, we use part $(e)$ of Definition 4.1 <> .

Thus $H$ is now a metric space. If this metric space is complete, i.e., if every Cauchy sequence converges in $H$, then $H$ is called a Hilbert space.

Throughout the rest of this chapter, the letter $H$ will denote a Hilbert space."
5.3,"Consider a linear transformation $\Lambda$ from a normed linear space $X$ into a normed linear space $Y$, and define its norm by

$$
\|\Lambda\|=\sup \{\|\Lambda x\|: x \in X,\|x\| \leq 1\} .

If $\|\Lambda\|<\infty$, then $\Lambda$ is called a bounded linear transformation.

In (1) <$$
\[
\left(x+V_{x}+V_{x}\right) \cap\left(C+V_{x}\right)=\varnothing
\]$$>, $\|x\|$ is the norm of $x$ in $X,\|\Lambda x\|$ is the norm of $\Lambda x$ in $Y$; it will frequently happen that several norms occur together, and the context will make it clear which is which.

Observe that we could restrict ourselves to unit vectors $x$ in (1) <$$
\[
\left(x+V_{x}+V_{x}\right) \cap\left(C+V_{x}\right)=\varnothing
\]$$>, i.e., to $x$ with $\|x\|=1$, without changing the supremum, since

$$
\|\Lambda(\alpha x)\|=\|\alpha \Lambda x\|=|\alpha|\|\Lambda x\| .
$$

Observe also that $\|\Lambda\|$ is the smallest number such that the inequality

$$
\|\Lambda x\| \leq\|\Lambda\|\|x\|
$$

holds for every $x \in X$.

The following geometric picture is helpful: $\Lambda$ maps the closed unit ball in $X$, i.e., the set

$$
\{x \in X:\|x\| \leq 1\}
$$

into the closed ball in $Y$ with center at 0 and radius $\|\Lambda\|$.

An important special case is obtained by taking the complex field for $Y$; in that case we talk about bounded linear functionals."

2.1,"A complex vector space (or a vector space over the complex field) is a set $V$, whose elements are called vectors and in which two operations, called addition and scalar multiplication, are defined, with the following familiar algebraic properties:

To every pair of vectors $x$ and $y$ there corresponds a vector $x+y$, in such a way that $x+y=y+x$ and $x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z ; V$ contains a unique vector 0 (the zero vector or origin of $V$ ) such that $x+0=x$ for every $x \in V$; and to each $x \in V$ there corresponds a unique vector $-x$ such that $x+(-x)=0$.

To each pair $(\alpha, x)$, where $x \in V$ and $\alpha$ is a scalar (in this context, the word scalar means complex number), there is associated a vector $\alpha x \in V$, in such a way that $1 x=x, \alpha(\beta x)=(\alpha \beta) x$, and such that the two distributive laws

$$
\alpha(x+y)=\alpha x+\alpha y,(\alpha+\beta) x=\alpha x+\beta x
$$

hold.

A linear transformation of a vector space $V$ into a vector space $V_{1}$ is a mapping $\Lambda$ of $V$ into $V_{1}$ such that

$$
\Lambda(\alpha x+\beta y)=\alpha \Lambda x+\beta \Lambda y
$$

for all $x$ and $y \in V$ and for all scalars $\alpha$ and $\beta$. In the special case in which $V_{1}$ is the field of scalars (this is the simplest example of a vector space, except for the trivial one consisting of 0 alone), $\Lambda$ is called a linear functional. A linear functional is thus a complex function on $V$ which satisfies (2) <$$

5.2 (a),"For a complex vector space $X$: A complex vector space $X$ is said to be a normed linear space if to each $x \in X$ there is associated a nonnegative real number $\|x\|$, called the norm of $x$, such that $\|x+y\| \leq\|x\|+\|y\|$ for all $x$ and $y \in X$."

1.35,"Let $P$ be a property which a point $x$ may or may not have. For instance, $P$ might be the property "" $f(x)>0$ "" if $f$ is a given function, or it might be "" $\left\{f_{n}(x)\right\}$ converges"" if $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ is a given sequence of functions.

If $\mu$ is a measure on a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathfrak{M}$ and if $E \in \mathfrak{M}$, the statement "" $P$ holds almost everywhere on $E$ "" (abbreviated to "" $P$ holds a.e. on $E$ "") means that there exists an $N \in \mathfrak{M}$ such that $\mu(N)=0, N \subset E$, and $P$ holds at every point of $E-N$. This concept of a.e. depends of course very strongly on the given measure, and we shall write ""a.e. $[\mu]$ "" whenever clarity requires that the measure be indicated.

For example, if $f$ and $g$ are measurable functions and if

$$
\mu(\{x: f(x) \neq g(x)\})=0
$$

we say that $f=g$ a.e. $[\mu]$ on $X$, and we may write $f \sim g$. This is easily seen to be an equivalence relation. The transitivity $(f \sim g$ and $g \sim h$ implies $f \sim h)$ is a consequence of the fact that the union of two sets of measure 0 has measure 0 .

Note that if $f \sim g$, then, for every $E \in \mathfrak{M}$,

$$
\int_{E} f d \mu=\int_{E} g d \mu
$$

To see this, let $N$ be the set which appears in (1) <$$
\[
\left(x+V_{x}+V_{x}\right) \cap\left(C+V_{x}\right)=\varnothing
\]$$>; then $E$ is the union of the disjoint sets $E-N$ and $E \cap N$; on $E-N, f=g$, and $\mu(E \cap N)=0$.

Thus, generally speaking, sets of measure 0 are negligible in integration. It ought to be true that every subset of a negligible set is negligible. But it may happen that some set $N \in \mathfrak{M}$ with $\mu(N)=0$ has a subset $E$ which is not a member of $\mathfrak{M}$. Of course we can define $\mu(E)=0$ in this case. But will this extension of $\mu$ still be a measure, i.e., will it still be defined on a $\sigma$-algebra? It is a pleasant fact that the answer is affirmative:"

(a) Characteristic functions of open sets are lower semicontinuous.

(b) Characteristic functions of closed sets are upper semicontinuous.

Observe that $C_{c}(X)$ is a vector space. This is due to two facts:

(a) The support of $f+g$ lies in the union of the support of $f$ and the support of $g$, and any finite union of compact sets is compact.

(b) The sum of two continuous complex functions is continuous, as are scalar multiples of continuous functions.

For instance, the sequence $\left\{z^{n}\right\}$ converges to 0 uniformly on compact subsets of $D(0 ; 1)$, but the convergence is not uniform in $D(0 ; 1)$.

It is uniform convergence on compact subsets which arises most naturally in connection with limit operations on holomorphic functions. The term ""almost uniform convergence"" is sometimes used for this concept."

On the other hand, $\pi_{m}(D(0 ; r))=D\left(0 ; r^{m}\right)$. Compositions of open mappings are clearly open. In particular, $\pi_{m} \circ \varphi$ is open, by Theorem 10.30 <>  <> , if $\varphi^{\prime}$ has no zero. The following theorem (which contains the more detailed version of the open mapping theorem that was mentioned prior to Lemma 10.29 <> ) states a converse: Every nonconstant holomorphic function in a region is locally of the form $\pi_{m} \circ \varphi$, except for an additive constant."

10.1 (a),"For $r>0$ and $a$ a complex number: $D(a ; r)=\{z:|z-a|<r\}$ is the open circular disc with center at $a$ and radius $r$. $\bar{D}(a ; r)$ is the closure of $D(a ; r)$, and $D^{\prime}(a ; r)=\{z: 0<|z-a|<r\}$ is the punctured disc with center at $a$ and radius $r$."
10.1 (b),"For a topological space $X$ and a set $E$: A set $E$ in a topological space $X$ is said to be not connected if $E$ is the union of two nonempty sets $A$ and $B$ such that

$$
\bar{A} \cap B=\varnothing=A \cap \bar{B}
$$

If $A$ and $B$ are as above, and if $V$ and $W$ are the complements of $\bar{A}$ and $\bar{B}$, respectively, it follows that $A \subset W$ and $B \subset V$. Hence

$$
E \subset V \cup W, \quad E \cap V \neq \varnothing, \quad E \cap W \neq \varnothing, \quad E \cap V \cap W=\varnothing
$$

Conversely, if open sets $V$ and $W$ exist such that (4) <$$ f(x)=\inf \{r: x \in A(r)\} \quad(x \in X)$$> holds, it is easy to see that $E$ is not connected, by taking $A=E \cap W, B=E \cap V$.

If $E$ is closed and not connected, then (3) <$$
\[
A(r)=c_{1}(r) V_{1}+c_{2}(r) V_{2}+c_{3}(r) V_{3}+\cdots

If $E$ is open and not connected, then (4) <$$ f(x)=\inf \{r: x \in A(r)\} \quad(x \in X)$$> shows that $E$ is the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets, namely $E \cap V$ and $E \cap W$.

Each set consisting of a single point is obviously connected. If $x \in E$, the family $\Phi_{x}$ of all connected subsets of $E$ that contain $x$ is therefore not empty. The union of all members of $\Phi_{x}$ is easily seen to be connected, and to be a maximal connected subset of $E$. These sets are called the components of $E$. Any two components of $E$ are thus disjoint, and $E$ is the union of its components.

By a region we shall mean a nonempty connected open subset of the complex plane. Since each open set $\Omega$ in the plane is a union of discs, and since all discs are connected, each component of $\Omega$ is open. Every plane open set is thus a union of disjoint regions. The letter $\Omega$ will from now on denote a plane open set."

\alpha(x y)=x(\alpha y)=(\alpha x) y
$$

for $x$ and $y \in A, \alpha$ a scalar.

If there is a norm defined in $A$ which makes $A$ into a normed linear space and which satisfies the multiplicative inequality

$$
\|x y\| \leq\|x\|\|y\| \quad(x \text { and } y \in A)
$$

then $\boldsymbol{A}$ is a normed complex algebra. If, in addition, $\boldsymbol{A}$ is a complete metric space relative to this norm, i.e., if $\boldsymbol{A}$ is a Banach space, then we call $\boldsymbol{A}$ a Banach algebra.

The inequality (3) <$$
\[
A(r)=c_{1}(r) V_{1}+c_{2}(r) V_{2}+c_{3}(r) V_{3}+\cdots
\]$$> makes multiplication a continuous operation. This means that if $x_{n} \rightarrow x$ and $y_{n} \rightarrow y$, then $x_{n} y_{n} \rightarrow x y$, which follows from (3) <$$
\[
A(r)=c_{1}(r) V_{1}+c_{2}(r) V_{2}+c_{3}(r) V_{3}+\cdots
\]$$> and the identity

$$
x_{n} y_{n}-x y=\left(x_{n}-x\right) y_{n}+x\left(y_{n}-y\right) .
$$

Note that we have not required that $A$ be commutative, i.e., that $x y=y x$ for all $x$ and $y \in A$, and we shall not do so except when explicitly stated.

However, we shall assume that $A$ has a unit. This is an element $e$ such that

$$
x e=e x=x \quad(x \in A) .
$$

It is easily seen that there is at most one such $e\left(e^{\prime}=e^{\prime} e=e\right)$ and that $\|e\| \geq 1$, by (3) <$$
\[
A(r)=c_{1}(r) V_{1}+c_{2}(r) V_{2}+c_{3}(r) V_{3}+\cdots
\]$$>. We shall make the additional assumption that

$$
\|e\|=1
$$

An element $x \in A$ will be called invertible if $x$ has an inverse in $A$, i.e., if there exists an element $x^{-1} \in A$ such that

$$
x^{-1} x=x x^{-1}=e
$$

Again, it is easily seen that no $x \in A$ has more than one inverse.

If $x$ and $y$ are invertible in $A$, so are $x^{-1}$ and $x y$, since $(x y)^{-1}=y^{-1} x^{-1}$. The invertible elements therefore form a group with respect to multiplication.

The spectrum of an element $x \in A$ is the set of all complex numbers $\lambda$ such that $x-\lambda e$ is not invertible. We shall denote the spectrum of $x$ by $\sigma(x)$."
18.2,"The theory of Banach algebras contains a great deal of interplay between algebraic properties on the one hand and topological ones on the other. We already saw an example of this in Theorem 9.21 <> , and shall see others. There are also close relations between Banach algebras and holomorphic functions: The easiest proof of the fundamental fact that $\sigma(x)$ is never empty depends on Liouville's theorem concerning entire functions, and the spectral radius formula follows naturally from theorems about power series. This is one reason for restricting our attention to complex Banach algebras. The theory of real Banach algebras (we omit the definition, which should be obvious) is not so satisfactory.

## The Invertible Elements

In this section, $A$ will be a complex Banach algebra with unit $e$, and $G$ will be the set of all invertible elements of $A$."
7.22,"Suppose $V$ is an open set in $R^{k}, T$ maps $V$ into $R^{k}$, and $x \in V$. If there exists a linear operator $A$ on $R^{k}$ (i.e., a linear mapping of $R^{k}$ into $R^{k}$, as in Definition 2.1 <> ) such that

$$
\lim _{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{|T(x+h)-T(x)-A h|}{|h|}=0
$$

(where, of course, $h \in R^{k}$ ), then we say that $T$ is differentiable at $x$, and define

$$
T^{\prime}(x)=A \text {. }
$$

The linear operator $T^{\prime}(x)$ is called the derivative of $T$ at $x$. (One shows easily that there is at most one linear $\boldsymbol{A}$ that satisfies the preceding requirements; thus it is legitimate to talk about the derivative of $T$.) The term differential is also often used for $T^{\prime}(x)$.

The point of (1) <$$
\[
\left(x+V_{x}+V_{x}\right) \cap\left(C+V_{x}\right)=\varnothing
\]$$> is of course that the difference $T(x+h)-T(x)$ is approximated by $T^{\prime}(x) h$, a linear function of $h$.

Since every real number $\alpha$ gives rise to a linear operator on $R^{1}$ (mapping $h$ to $\alpha h$ ), our definition of $T^{\prime}(x)$ coincides with the usual one when $k=1$.

When $A: R^{k} \rightarrow R^{k}$ is linear, Theorem $2.20(e)$ shows that there is a number $\Delta(A)$ such that

$$
m(A(E))=\Delta(A) m(E)
$$

for all measurable sets $E \subset R^{k}$. Since

$$
A^{\prime}(x)=A \quad\left(x \in R^{k}\right)
$$

and since every differentiable transformation $T$ can be locally approximated by a constant plus a linear transformation, one may conjecture that

$$
\frac{m(T(E))}{m(E)} \sim \Delta\left(T^{\prime}(x)\right)
$$

for suitable sets $E$ that are close to $x$. This will be proved in Theorem 7.24 <> , and furnishes the motivation for Theorem 7.26 <> .

Recall that $\Delta(A)=|\operatorname{det} A|$ was proved in Sec. 2.23. When $T$ is differentiable at $x$, the determinant of $T^{\prime}(x)$ is called the Jacobian of $T$ at $x$, and is denoted by $J_{T}(x)$. Thus

$$
\Delta\left(T^{\prime}(x)\right)=\left|J_{T}(x)\right|
$$"
10.41,"A function $f$ is said to be meromorphic in an open set $\Omega$ if there is a set $A \subset \Omega$ such that

(a) $A$ has no limit point in $\Omega$,

(b) $f \in H(\Omega-A)$,

(c) $f$ has a pole at each point of $A$.

Note that the possibility $A=\varnothing$ is not excluded. Thus every $f \in H(\Omega)$ is meromorphic in $\Omega$.

Note also that $(a)$ implies that no compact subset of $\Omega$ contains infinitely many points of $A$, and that $A$ is therefore at most countable.

If $f$ and $A$ are as above, if $a \in A$, and if

$$
Q(z)=\sum_{k=1}^{m} c_{k}(z-a)^{-k}

4.7,"A subset $M$ of a vector space $V$ is called a subspace of $V$ if $M$ is itself a vector space, relative to the addition and scalar multiplication which are defined in $V$. A necessary and sufficient condition for a set $M \subset V$ to be a subspace is that $x+y \in M$ and $\alpha x \in M$ whenever $x$ and $y \in M$ and $\alpha$ is a scalar.

In the vector space context, the word ""subspace"" will always have this meaning. Sometimes, for emphasis, we may use the term ""linear subspace"" in place of subspace.

A closed subspace of $H$ is a subspace that is a closed set relative to the topology induced by the metric of $H$.

Note that if $M$ is a subspace of $H$, so is its closure $\bar{M}$. To see this, pick $x$ and $y$ in $\bar{M}$ and let $\alpha$ be a scalar. There are sequences $\left\{x_{n}\right\}$ and $\left\{y_{n}\right\}$ in $M$ that converge to $x$ and $y$, respectively. It is then easy to verify that $x_{n}+y_{n}$ and $\alpha x_{n}$ converge to $x+y$ and $\alpha x$, respectively. Thus $x+y \in \bar{M}$ and $\alpha x \in \bar{M}$."
4.8,"A set $E$ in a vector space $V$ is said to be convex if it has the following geometric property: Whenever $x \in E, y \in E$, and $0<t<1$, the point

$$
z_{t}=(1-t) x+t y
$$

also lies in $E$. As $t$ runs from 0 to 1 , one may visualize $z_{t}$ as describing a straight line segment in $V$, from $x$ to $y$. Convexity requires that $E$ contain the segments between any two of its points.

It is clear that every subspace of $V$ is convex.

Also, if $E$ is convex, so is each of its translates

$$
E+x=\{y+x: y \in E\} .
$$"
4.9,"If $(x, y)=0$ for some $x$ and $y \in H$, we say that $x$ is orthogonal to $y$, and sometimes write $x \perp y$. Since $(x, y)=0$ implies $(y, x)=0$, the relation $\perp$ is symmetric.

Let $x^{\perp}$ denote the set of all $y \in H$ which are orthogonal to $x$; and if $M$ is a subspace of $H$, let $M^{\perp}$ be the set of all $y \in H$ which are orthogonal to every $x \in M$.

Note that $x^{\perp}$ is a subspace of $H$, since $x \perp y$ and $x \perp y^{\prime}$ implies $x \perp\left(y+y^{\prime}\right)$ and $x \perp \alpha y$. Also, $x^{\perp}$ is precisely the set of points where the continuous function $y \rightarrow(x, y)$ is 0 . Hence $x^{\perp}$ is a closed subspace of $H$. Since

$$
M^{\perp}=\bigcap_{x \in M} x^{\perp}
$$

$M^{\perp}$ is an intersection of closed subspaces, and it follows that $M^{\perp}$ is a closed subspace of $H$."
4.23,"Let $T$ be the unit circle in the complex plane, i.e., the set of all complex numbers of absolute value 1. If $F$ is any function on $T$ and if $f$ is defined on $R^{1}$ by

$$
f(t)=F\left(e^{i t}\right)
$$

then $f$ is a periodic function of period $2 \pi$. This means that $f(t+2 \pi)=f(t)$ for all real $t$. Conversely, if $f$ is a function on $R^{1}$, with period $2 \pi$, then there is a function $F$ on $T$ such that the above holds. Thus we may identify functions on $T$ with $2 \pi$-periodic functions on $R^{1}$; and, for simplicity of notation, we shall sometimes write $f(t)$ rather than $f\left(e^{i t}\right)$, even if we think of $f$ as being defined on $T$.

With these conventions in mind, we define $L^{p}(T)$, for $1 \leq p<\infty$, to be the class of all complex, Lebesgue measurable, $2 \pi$-periodic functions on $R^{1}$ for which the norm

$$
\|f\|_{p}=\left\{\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}|f(t)|^{p} d t\right\}^{1 / p}
$$

is finite.

In other words, we are looking at $L^{p}(\mu)$, where $\mu$ is Lebesgue measure on $[0,2 \pi]$ (or on $T$ ), divided by $2 \pi$. $L^{\infty}(T)$ will be the class of all $2 \pi$-periodic members of $L^{\infty}\left(R^{1}\right)$, with the essential supremum norm, and $C(T)$ consists of all continuous complex functions on $T$ (or, equivalently, of all continuous, complex, $2 \pi$-periodic functions on $R^{1}$ ), with norm

$$
\|f\|_{\infty}=\sup |f(t)|,
$$

The factor $1 /(2 \pi)$ in the norm definition simplifies the formalism for $L^{p}(T)$ spaces. A trigonometric polynomial is a finite sum of the form

$$
f(t)=a_{0}+\sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(a_{n} \cos n t+b_{n} \sin n t\right) \quad\left(t \in R^{1}\right)
$$

where $a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots, a_{N}$ and $b_{1}, \ldots, b_{N}$ are complex numbers. On account of the Euler identities, this can also be written in the form

$$
f(t)=\sum_{n=-N}^{N} c_{n} e^{i n t}
$$

which is more convenient for most purposes. It is clear that every trigonometric polynomial has period $2 \pi$.

We shall denote the set of all integers (positive, zero, and negative) by $Z$, and put

$$
u_{n}(t)=e^{i n t} \quad(n \in Z)
$$

If we define the inner product in $L^{2}(T)$ by

$$
(f, g)=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(t) \overline{g(t)} d t
$$

[note that this is in agreement with the norm definition], an easy computation shows that

$$
\left(u_{n}, u_{m}\right)=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} e^{i(n-m) t} d t= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } n=m \\ 0 & \text { if } n \neq m\end{cases}
$$

Thus $\left\{u_{n}: n \in Z\right\}$ is an orthonormal set in $L^{2}(T)$, usually called the trigonometric system."
2.19,"Euclidean $k$-dimensional space $R^{k}$ is the set of all points $x=\left(\xi_{1}, \ldots, \xi_{k}\right)$ whose coordinates $\xi_{i}$ are real numbers, with the following algebraic and topological structure:

If $x=\left(\xi_{1}, \ldots, \xi_{k}\right), y=\left(\eta_{1}, \ldots, \eta_{k}\right)$, and $\alpha$ is a real number, $x+y$ and $\alpha x$ are defined by

$$
x+y=\left(\xi_{1}+\eta_{1}, \ldots, \xi_{k}+\eta_{k}\right), \quad \alpha x=\left(\alpha \xi_{1}, \ldots, \alpha \xi_{k}\right)
$$

This makes $R^{k}$ into a real vector space. If $x \cdot y=\sum \xi_{i} \eta_{i}$ and $|x|=(x \cdot x)^{1 / 2}$, the Schwarz inequality $|x \cdot y| \leq|x||y|$ leads to the triangle inequality

$$
|x-y| \leq|x-z|+|z-y|
$$

hence we obtain a metric by setting $\rho(x, y)=|x-y|$. We assume that these facts are familiar and shall prove them in greater generality in Chap. 4.

If $E \subset R^{k}$ and $x \in R^{k}$, the translate of $E$ by $x$ is the set

$$
E+x=\{y+x: y \in E\}
$$

A set of the form

$$
W=\left\{x: \alpha_{i}<\xi_{i}<\beta_{i}, 1 \leq i \leq k\right\}
$$

or any set obtained by replacing any or all of the $<$ signs in (4) <$$ f(x)=\inf \{r: x \in A(r)\} \quad(x \in X)$$> by $\leq$, is called a $k$-cell; its volume is defined to be

$$
\operatorname{vol}(W)=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\left(\beta_{i}-\alpha_{i}\right)
$$

If $a \in R^{k}$ and $\delta>0$, we shall call the set

$$
Q(a ; \delta)=\left\{x: \alpha_{i} \leq \xi_{i}<\alpha_{i}+\delta, 1 \leq i \leq k\right\}
$$

the $\delta$-box with corner at $a$. Here $a=\left(\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{k}\right)$.

For $n=1,2,3, \ldots$, we let $P_{n}$ be the set of all $x \in R^{k}$ whose coordinates are integral multiples of $2^{-n}$, and we let $\Omega_{n}$ be the collection of all $2^{-n}$ boxes with corners at points of $P_{n}$. We shall need the following four properties of $\left\{\Omega_{n}\right\}$. The first three are obvious by inspection.

(a) If $n$ is fixed, each $x \in R^{k}$ lies in one and only one member of $\Omega_{n}$.

(b) If $Q^{\prime} \in \Omega_{n}, Q^{\prime \prime} \in \Omega_{r}$, and $r<n$, then either $Q^{\prime} \subset Q^{\prime \prime}$ or $Q^{\prime} \cap Q^{\prime \prime}=\varnothing$.

(c) If $Q \in \Omega_{r}$, then $\operatorname{vol}(Q)=2^{-r k}$; and if $n>r$, the set $P_{n}$ has exactly $2^{(n-r) k}$ points in $Q$.

(d) Every nonempty open set in $R^{k}$ is a countable union of disjoint boxes belonging to $\Omega_{1} \cup \Omega_{2} \cup \Omega_{3} \cup \cdots$.

17.7,"If $f \in H(U)$ and $0 \leq p \leq \infty$, we put

$$
\|f\|_{p}=\sup \left\{\left\|f_{r}\right\|_{p}: 0 \leq r<1\right\} .

If $0<p \leq \infty, H^{p}$ is defined to be the class of all $f \in H(U)$ for which $\|f\|_{p}<\infty$. The class $N$ consists of all $f \in H(U)$ for which $\|f\|_{0}<\infty$. It is clear that $H^{\infty} \subset H^{p} \subset H^{s} \subset N$ if $0<s<p<\infty$."
17.8 (a),"When $p<\infty$, Theorems 17.3 and 17.5 show that $\left\|f_{r}\right\|_{p}$ is a nondecreasing function of $r$, for every $f \in H(U)$; when $p=\infty$, the same follows from the maximum modulus theorem. Hence

$$
\|f\|_{p}=\lim _{r \rightarrow 1}\left\|f_{r}\right\|_{p}

"
17.8 (b),"For $1 \leq p \leq \infty,\|f\|_{p}$ satisfies the triangle inequality, so that $H^{p}$ is a normed linear space. To see this, note that the Minkowski inequality gives

17.8 (c),"Actually, $H^{p}$ is a Banach space, if $1 \leq p \leq \infty$ : To prove completeness, suppose $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $H^{p},|z| \leq r<R<1$, and apply the Cauchy formula to $f_{n}-f_{m}$, integrating around the circle of radius $R$, center 0 . This leads to the inequalities

$$
(R-r)\left|f_{n}(z)-f_{m}(z)\right| \leq\left\|\left(f_{n}-f_{m}\right)_{R}\right\|_{1} \leq\left\|\left(f_{n}-f_{m}\right)_{R}\right\|_{p} \leq\left\|f_{n}-f_{m}\right\|_{p}
$$

from which we conclude that $\left\{f_{n}\right\}$ converges uniformly on compact subsets of $U$ to a function $f \in H(U)$. Given $\epsilon>0$, there is an $m$ such that $\left\|f_{n}-f_{m}\right\|_{p}<\epsilon$ for all $n>m$, and then, for every $r<1$,

$$
\left\|\left(f-f_{m}\right)_{r}\right\|_{p}=\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left\|\left(f_{n}-f_{m}\right)_{r}\right\|_{p} \leq \epsilon

18.12,"A subset $I$ of a commutative complex algebra $A$ is said to be an ideal if $(a) I$ is a subspace of $A$ (in the vector space sense) and $(b) x y \in I$ whenever $x \in A$ and $y \in I$. If $I \neq A, I$ is a proper ideal. Maximal ideals are proper ideals which are not contained in any larger proper ideals. Note that no proper ideal contains an invertible element.

If $B$ is another complex algebra, a mapping $\varphi$ of $A$ into $B$ is called a homomorphism if $\varphi$ is a linear mapping which also preserves multiplication: $\varphi(x) \varphi(y)=\varphi(x y)$ for all $x$ and $y \in A$. The kernel (or null space) of $\varphi$ is the set of all $x \in A$ such that $\varphi(x)=0$. It is trivial to verify that the kernel of a homomorphism is an ideal. For the converse, see Sec. 18.14."
