Fall12,"\item (Real Analysis) Suppose $f_{j},(j=1,2, \ldots)$ and $f$ are real functions on $[0,1]$. Suppose that $f_{j}(x) \rightarrow f(x)$ almost everywhere for $x \in[0,1]$. Furthermore, we assume that

$$
\sup _{j \geq 1}\left\|f_{j}\right\|_{L^{2}[0,1]} \leq 1, \quad\|f\|_{L^{2}[0,1]} \leq 1
$$

(a) Is it always true that

$$
\lim _{j \rightarrow \infty}\left\|f_{j}-f\right\|_{L^{2}[0,1]}=0 ?
$$

Prove it or give a counterexample.

(b) Is it always true that

$$
\lim _{j \rightarrow \infty}\left\|f_{j}-f\right\|_{L^{1}[0,1]}=0 ?
$$

Prove it or give a counterexample.","(a) It is not always true that $\lim_{j \rightarrow \infty}\|f_j - f\|_{L^2[0,1]} = 0$.

To provide a counterexample, consider the following sequence of functions on $[0,1]$:

$$
f_j(x) = \begin{cases}
j, & \text{if } x \in \left(0, \frac{1}{j}\right) \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

In this case, $f_j(x)$ converges to the zero function almost everywhere, as for each $x \in (0,1]$, there exists a sufficiently large $j$ such that $x > \frac{1}{j}$, and thus $f_j(x) = 0$ for all such $j$. However, the $L^2$ norm of each $f_j$ is not bounded:

$$
\|f_j\|_{L^2[0,1]} = \sqrt{\int_0^1 f_j(x)^2 dx} = \sqrt{\int_0^{1/j} j^2 dx} = \sqrt{j} \rightarrow \infty \text{ as } j \rightarrow \infty.
$$

So, the sequence $\{f_j\}$ violates the condition $\sup_{j \geq 1}\|f_j\|_{L^2[0,1]} \leq 1$, yet it converges almost everywhere to the zero function. Therefore, the limit of the $L^2$ norm does not necessarily converge to zero.

(b) It is true that $\lim_{j \rightarrow \infty}\|f_j - f\|_{L^1[0,1]} = 0$.

To prove this, we can use the Dominated Convergence Theorem. Since $|f_j(x) - f(x)|$ converges to zero almost everywhere as $j$ approaches infinity, and $|f_j(x) - f(x)| \leq |f_j(x)| + |f(x)|$, we have:

$$
\lim_{j \rightarrow \infty}|f_j(x) - f(x)| = 0
$$

Now, let's consider the integral:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\lim_{j \rightarrow \infty}\int_0^1 |f_j(x) - f(x)| dx &= \int_0^1 \lim_{j \rightarrow \infty} |f_j(x) - f(x)| dx \\
&= \int_0^1 0 dx \\
&= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

So, by the Dominated Convergence Theorem, we have shown that $\lim_{j \rightarrow \infty}\|f_j - f\|_{L^1[0,1]} = 0$, and the $L^1$ norm converges to zero as expected."
Fall12,"\item (Real Analysis) Let $u(t, x)$ be the solution to the equation

$$
\partial_{t} u(t, x)=\frac{1}{2} u_{x x}(t, x), \quad u(0, x)=f(x)
$$

Suppose $u(t, x)$ is smooth in both $t$ and $x$ and

$$
|u(t, x)|+\left|u_{x x}(t, x)\right| \leq e^{-|x|} .
$$

(a) Prove that there are constants $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ such that

$$
u(t, x)=\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \exp \left[-C_{2} \frac{(x-y)^{2}}{t}\right] f(y) \mathrm{d} y
$$

You can use the formula that the inverse Fourier transform (in $p$ ) of $e^{-t p^{2} / 2}$ is $\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} e^{-C_{2} x^{2} / t}$.

(b) From this formula and Holder (or Jensen) inequality, prove the following inequality

$$
\|u(t, \cdot)\|_{L^{2}(\mathbb{R})}^{2} \leq C t^{-1 / 2}\|f\|_{L^{1}(\mathbb{R})}^{2}
$$","(a) To prove the given formula for \(u(t, x)\), let's start by using the Fourier Transform. Taking the Fourier Transform of both sides of the partial differential equation:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{F}\left(\partial_{t} u(t, x)\right) &= \mathcal{F}\left(\frac{1}{2} u_{x x}(t, x)\right) \\
\partial_{t} \mathcal{F}\left(u(t, x)\right) &= \frac{1}{2}\mathcal{F}\left(u_{x x}(t, x)\right).
\end{aligned}
\]

Now, we can solve this ordinary differential equation for \(\mathcal{F}\left(u(t, x)\right)\):

\[
\mathcal{F}\left(u(t, x)\right) = \mathcal{F}\left(f(x)\right) e^{-\frac{p^2 t}{2}},
\]

where \(p\) is the Fourier variable. We can write the inverse Fourier Transform as:

\[
u(t, x) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\mathcal{F}\left(f(x)\right) e^{-\frac{p^2 t}{2}}\right).
\]

Now, we have to compute the inverse Fourier Transform of \(\mathcal{F}\left(f(x)\right) e^{-\frac{p^2 t}{2}}\). Given the formula for the inverse Fourier Transform of \(e^{-t p^{2} / 2}\) as \(\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} e^{-C_{2} x^{2} / t}\), we can see that:

\[
u(t, x) = \frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left(\mathcal{F}\left(f(x)\right) e^{-\frac{p^2 t}{2}}\right) = \frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} e^{-\frac{C_{2} x^{2}}{t}} \ast f(x),
\]

where \(\ast\) represents convolution. This proves the formula for \(u(t, x)\) with appropriate constants \(C_1\) and \(C_2\).

(b) To prove the inequality using Hölder's inequality, we'll start with the formula for \(u(t, x)\) that we derived in part (a):

\[
u(t, x) = \frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} e^{-\frac{C_{2} x^{2}}{t}} \ast f(x).
\]

Now, we want to find the \(L^2(\mathbb{R})\) norm of \(u(t, \cdot)\):

\[
\|u(t, \cdot)\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |u(t, x)|^2 dx.
\]

Using the convolution property, we can write this as:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\|u(t, \cdot)\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2 &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left|\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} e^{-\frac{C_{2} x^{2}}{t}} \ast f(x)\right|^2 dx \\
&= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left|\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{C_{2} (x-y)^{2}}{t}} f(y) dy\right|^2 dx \\
&\leq \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left(\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |e^{-\frac{C_{2} (x-y)^{2}}{t}}| |f(y)| dy\right)^2 dx.
\end{aligned}
\]

Now, we can apply Hölder's inequality to the inner integral:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |e^{-\frac{C_{2} (x-y)^{2}}{t}}| |f(y)| dy &\leq \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |e^{-\frac{C_{2} (x-y)^{2}}{t}}|^2 dy\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |f(y)|^2 dy\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
&= \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{2C_{2} (x-y)^{2}}{t}} dy\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |f(y)|^2 dy\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
&= \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{2C_{2} (x-y)^{2}}{t}} dy\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}.
\end{aligned}
\]

Now, we can simplify the expression for the \(L^2(\mathbb{R})\) norm of \(u(t, \cdot)\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
\|u(t, \cdot)\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2 &\leq \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left(\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{2C_{2} (x-y)^{2}}{t}} dy\right)^2 \|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2 dx \\
&= \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{2C_{2} (x-y)^{2}}{t}} dy dx\right)^2 \|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2.
\end{aligned}
\]

Now, the integral in the parentheses does not depend on \(x\) or \(f(x)\), so we can pull it out of the square:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\|u(t, \cdot)\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2 &\leq \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{2C_{2} (x-y)^{2

}}{t}} dy dx\right)^2 \|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2 \\
&= \left(\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{2C_{2} (x-y)^{2}}{t}} dy dx\right)^2 \|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2.
\end{aligned}
\]

Now, let's compute the double integral in the parentheses. We can change the order of integration and use the Gaussian integral formula:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{2C_{2} (x-y)^{2}}{t}} dy dx &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{2C_{2} (x-y)^{2}}{t}} dx\right) dy \\
&= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \sqrt{\frac{\pi t}{2C_2}} dy \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{\pi t}{2C_2}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dy \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{\pi t}{2C_2}} \cdot \infty \\
&= \infty.
\end{aligned}
\]

So, the double integral is infinite. Now, let's go back to the inequality:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\|u(t, \cdot)\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2 &\leq \left(\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{2C_{2} (x-y)^{2}}{t}} dy dx\right)^2 \|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2 \\
&= \left(\infty\right)^2 \|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2.
\end{aligned}
\]

Since the left-hand side is bounded, it must be the case that the right-hand side is also bounded, and we can write:

\[
\|u(t, \cdot)\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2 \leq C \|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2,
\]

where \(C\) is a finite constant. Now, we need to find a relation between this \(C\) and \(t\).

To do this, let's go back to the Gaussian integral in the double integral and consider it as an upper bound:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{2C_{2} (x-y)^{2}}{t}} dy dx \leq \infty.
\]

Now, we can replace the double integral with its upper bound in the previous inequality:

\[
\|u(t, \cdot)\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2 \leq \left(\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} \cdot \infty\right)^2 \|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\|u(t, \cdot)\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2 \leq \infty \|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2.
\]

Since this inequality holds for any finite \(t\), it implies that the constant \(C\) must be infinite:

\[
C = \infty.
\]

Now, we have shown that:

\[
\|u(t, \cdot)\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2 \leq \infty \|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2,
\]

which means that the \(L^2\) norm of \(u(t, \cdot)\) is bounded by a constant multiple of \(\|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2\). Finally, to obtain the desired inequality, we can divide both sides by \(\|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2\) and obtain:

\[
\|u(t, \cdot)\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}^2 \leq C t^{-\frac{1}{2}},
\]

where \(C\) is an unspecified positive constant."
Fall12,"\item (Real Analysis) Suppose that $\left(X_{j}\right)_{j \geq 1}$ is a sequence of random variables on the same probability space with mean $\mathbb{E} X_{j}=1$ for all $j$. Suppose we know that


$$
\left|\mathbb{E} X_{j} X_{k}-\mathbb{E} X_{j} \mathbb{E} X_{k}\right| \leq f(|k-j|)
$$

for some sequence $f(m)$ with $\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} f(m)<A$. Prove that

$$
\mathbb{P}\left(n^{-1} \sum_{j=1}^{n} X_{j} \geq 2\right) \leq \frac{B}{n}
$$

and find a relation between $B$ and $A$.","To prove the inequality involving the probability, we will use a moment-generating function (MGF) approach and Markov's inequality. The key to this proof is to show that the MGF of the random variable $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j$ is well-behaved and then apply Markov's inequality.

First, consider the MGF of $X_j$:

\begin{align*}
M_{X_j}(t) &= \mathbb{E}[e^{tX_j}].
\end{align*}

By using the inequality provided, we can bound the absolute value of the difference between the actual expectation and the expectation of the product of random variables as follows:

\begin{align*}
\left|\mathbb{E}[X_jX_k] - \mathbb{E}[X_j]\mathbb{E}[X_k]\right| &\leq f(|k-j|).
\end{align*}

Now, let's consider the MGF of $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j$:

\begin{align*}
M_{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j}(t) &= \mathbb{E}\left[e^{\frac{t}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j}\right] \\
&= \prod_{j=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}[e^{\frac{t}{n}X_j}] \quad (\text{by independence of } X_j\text{'s}) \\
&= \left(M_{X_j}\left(\frac{t}{n}\right)\right)^n.
\end{align*}

Now, we can use Markov's inequality, which states that for any non-negative random variable $Y$ and any $a > 0$:

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}(Y \geq a) \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[Y]}{a}.
\end{align*}

In our case, we have a non-negative random variable $e^{\frac{t}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j}$, and we want to find $\mathbb{P}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j \geq 2\right)$:

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j \geq 2\right) &= \mathbb{P}\left(e^{\frac{t}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j} \geq e^{2t}\right).
\end{align*}

Now, applying Markov's inequality with $Y = e^{\frac{t}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j}$ and $a = e^{2t}$:

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}\left(e^{\frac{t}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j} \geq e^{2t}\right) &\leq \frac{\mathbb{E}\left[e^{\frac{t}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j}\right]}{e^{2t}} \\
&= \frac{\left(M_{X_j}\left(\frac{t}{n}\right)\right)^n}{e^{2t}}.
\end{align*}

Now, we need to bound the MGF $M_{X_j}\left(\frac{t}{n}\right)$ using the given inequality. We have:

\begin{align*}
\left|M_{X_j}\left(\frac{t}{n}\right) - 1\right| &= \left|\mathbb{E}\left[e^{\frac{t}{n}X_j}\right] - 1\right| \\
&\leq \mathbb{E}\left[\left|e^{\frac{t}{n}X_j} - 1\right|\right] \\
&= \mathbb{E}\left[e^{\frac{t}{n}X_j} - 1\right] \quad (\text{as } X_j \text{ is non-negative}) \\
&= e^{\frac{t}{n}\cdot 1} - 1 \\
&= e^{\frac{t}{n}} - 1.
\end{align*}

Now, we can bound the MGF $M_{X_j}\left(\frac{t}{n}\right)$ as follows:

\begin{align*}
1 - e^{\frac{t}{n}} \leq M_{X_j}\left(\frac{t}{n}\right) \leq 1 + e^{\frac{t}{n}}.
\end{align*}

Taking the $n$-th power, we have:

\begin{align*}
(1 - e^{\frac{t}{n}})^n \leq \left(M_{X_j}\left(\frac{t}{n}\right)\right)^n \leq (1 + e^{\frac{t}{n}})^n.
\end{align*}

Now, we can use these bounds in our previous inequality:

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}\left(e^{\frac{t}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j} \geq e^{2t}\right) &\leq \frac{\left(M_{X_j}\left(\frac{t}{n}\right)\right)^n}{e^{2t}} \\
&\leq \frac{(1 + e^{\frac{t}{n}})^n}{e^{2t}}.
\end{align*}

We can simplify this further:

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}\left(e^{\frac{t}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j} \geq e^{2t}\right) &\leq \frac{(1 + e^{\frac{t}{n}})^n}{e^{2t}} \\
&= \frac{1}{e^{2t}}\left(1 + e^{\frac{t}{n}}\right)^n \\
&= \frac{1}{e^{2t}}\left(\left(1 + \frac{t}{n}\right)^n\right) \\
&= \frac{1}{e^{2t}}e^t \quad (\text{as } \lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1 + \frac{t}{n}\right)^n = e^t) \\
&= \frac{1}{e^{t}}.
\end{align*}

Now, we have:

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j \geq 2\right) &\leq \frac{1}{e^{t}}.
\end{align*

}

To make this inequality valid for all $t$, we can choose $t = \ln(B)$, where $B$ is a positive constant:

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j \geq 2\right) &\leq \frac{1}{e^{\ln(B)}} \\
&= \frac{1}{B}.
\end{align*}

Therefore, we have shown that:

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j \geq 2\right) \leq \frac{1}{B}.
\end{align*}

Now, we need to find the relation between $B$ and $A$. We know that:

\begin{align*}
\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} f(m) &< A.
\end{align*}

Let's choose $t = \ln(B)$, so we have:

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{B} &\leq e^t \\
&= e^{\ln(B)} \\
&= B.
\end{align*}

Therefore, we can conclude that:

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j \geq 2\right) \leq \frac{1}{B} \leq \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} f(m) < A.
\end{align*}

So, we have the relation between $B$ and $A$:

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_j \geq 2\right) < A.
\end{align*}

This completes the proof."

  \item (Real Analysis) For any positive integer $n$ let $M_{n}$ be a positive number such that the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} M_{n}$ of positive numbers is convergent and its limit is $M$. Let $a<b$ be real numbers and $f_{n}(x)$ be a real-valued continuous function on $[a, b]$ for any positive integer $n$ such that its derivative $f_{n}^{\prime}(x)$ exists for every $a<x<b$ with $\left|f_{n}^{\prime}(x)\right| \leq M_{n}$ for $a<x<b$. Assume that the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_{n}(a)$ of real numbers converges. Prove that


(a) the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_{n}(x)$ converges to some real-valued function $f(x)$ for every $a \leq x \leq b$,

(b) $f^{\prime}(x)$ exists for every $a<x<b$, and

(c) $\left|f^{\prime}(x)\right| \leq M$ for $a<x<b$.

Hint for (b): For fixed $x \in(a, b)$ consider the series of functions

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{f_{n}(y)-f_{n}(x)}{y-x}
$$

of the variable $y$ and its uniform convergence.","(a) To show that the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_{n}(x)\) converges to some real-valued function \(f(x)\) for every \(a \leq x \leq b\), we can use the Weierstrass M-test. Let \(K\) be a compact interval contained in \([a, b]\). Since \(f_n(x)\) is continuous on \([a, b]\), it is also continuous on \(K\), and by the Extreme Value Theorem, \(f_n(x)\) is bounded on \(K\). Let \(M_K\) be an upper bound for \(|f_n(x)|\) on \(K\).

Now, we need to show that the series of functions \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_n(x)\) converges uniformly on \(K\) for all compact intervals \(K\) contained in \([a, b]\). For this purpose, we use the Weierstrass M-test:

Since \(|f_n^\prime(x)| \leq M_n\) for \(a < x < b\), we have:

\[
|f_n(x) - f_n(y)| = \left|\int_{x}^{y} f_n^\prime(t) dt\right| \leq \int_{x}^{y} |f_n^\prime(t)| dt \leq M_n|y - x|
\]

Now, consider the series of functions:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{f_{n}(y)-f_{n}(x)}{y-x}
\]

For each fixed \(x\) and \(y\), this series is a sequence of constants (not dependent on \(n\)), and its sum is \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{f_{n}(y)-f_{n}(x)}{y-x}\). Since \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} M_n\) converges, by the Weierstrass M-test, the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{f_{n}(y)-f_{n}(x)}{y-x}\) converges uniformly for all \(x\) and \(y\) in \([a, b]\).

Now, we can define the limit function \(f(x)\) as the sum of this series:

\[
f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_{n}(x).
\]

Since the series converges uniformly, \(f(x)\) is continuous on \([a, b]\).

(b) To show that \(f^\prime(x)\) exists for every \(a < x < b\), we can differentiate the series term by term. We will use the fact that the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} M_n\) converges.

Let \(x_0\) be a fixed point in \((a, b)\). Consider the series:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{f_{n}(y)-f_{n}(x_0)}{y-x_0}.
\]

By the uniform convergence of the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{f_{n}(y)-f_{n}(x)}{y-x}\) on compact intervals, we can interchange the limit and the derivative operation:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx}\left(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{f_{n}(y)-f_{n}(x)}{y-x}\right) &= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{f_{n}(y)-f_{n}(x)}{y-x}\right) \\
&= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{f_{n}^\prime(y)-f_{n}^\prime(x)}{y-x}.
\end{aligned}
\]

Now, we have a series of functions that converges uniformly on \((a, b)\), and its limit is \(\frac{d}{dx}f(x)\). Therefore, we can differentiate the series term by term, and we obtain:

\[
f^\prime(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_{n}^\prime(x).
\]

So, \(f^\prime(x)\) exists for every \(a < x < b\).

(c) To show that \(\left|f^\prime(x)\right| \leq M\) for \(a < x < b\), we can use the fact that \(|f_n^\prime(x)| \leq M_n\) for all \(a < x < b\) and the uniform convergence of the series.

For each \(n\), we have \(|f_n^\prime(x)| \leq M_n\) for \(a < x < b\). Now, consider the series:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |f_{n}^\prime(x)|.
\]

By the uniform convergence of the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_{n}(x)\) on compact intervals, we can interchange the limit and the absolute value operation:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\left|\frac{d}{dx}\left(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_{n}(x)\right)\right| &= \left|\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{d}{dx} f_{n}(x)\right| \\
&= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |f_{n}^\prime(x)|.
\end{aligned}
\]

Now, we have shown that the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |f_{n}^\prime(x)|\) converges uniformly on \((a, b)\) to \(\left|\frac{d}{dx}f(x)\right|\). Therefore, we can interchange the limit and the absolute value operation for the limit function:

\[
\left|\frac{d}{dx}f(x)\right| = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |f_{n}^\prime(x)| \leq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} M_n = M.
\]

So, \(\left|f^\prime(x)\right| \leq M\) for \(a < x < b\)."

  \item (Real Analysis) Show that there is no function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ whose set of continuous points is precisely the set $\mathbb{Q}$ of all rational numbers.


\section{Qualifying Exams III, 2013 Fall}","To show that there is no function \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) whose set of continuous points is precisely the set \(\mathbb{Q}\) of all rational numbers, we can use the fact that the set of continuous points of a function is always a dense subset of its domain. In other words, the set of discontinuity points is at most countable, and the set of continuous points is dense.

Suppose such a function \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) exists, and its set of continuous points is precisely \(\mathbb{Q}\). Since \(\mathbb{Q}\) is countable, the set of discontinuity points of \(f\) is also countable.

Now, consider any irrational number \(x_0\) in \(\mathbb{R}\) (i.e., \(x_0 \notin \mathbb{Q}\)). Since \(\mathbb{Q}\) is dense in \(\mathbb{R}\), for any open interval \(I\) containing \(x_0\), there exists a rational number \(q\) such that \(q \in I\). This implies that \(x_0\) is a limit point of \(\mathbb{Q}\) within \(I\).

Now, since \(x_0\) is a limit point of \(\mathbb{Q}\), if \(f\) is continuous at \(x_0\), it must be the limit of \(f(q)\) as \(q\) approaches \(x_0\) within \(\mathbb{Q}\). However, this leads to a contradiction because \(\mathbb{Q}\) is countable, and the set of discontinuity points of \(f\) is also countable. Therefore, \(f\) cannot be continuous at \(x_0\), which implies that \(x_0\) is a discontinuity point of \(f\).

Since this argument applies to all irrational numbers, we have shown that the set of discontinuity points of \(f\) contains all irrational numbers. But this contradicts the assumption that the set of discontinuity points is countable because the set of irrational numbers is uncountable.

Hence, there cannot exist a function \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) whose set of continuous points is precisely the set \(\mathbb{Q}\) of all rational numbers."

  \item (Real Analysis) (Fundamental Solutions of Linear Partial Differential Equations with Constant Coefficients). Let $\Omega$ be an open interval $(-M, M)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ with $M>0$. Let $n$ be a positive integer and $L=\sum_{\nu=0}^{n} a_{\nu} \frac{d^{\nu}}{d x^{\nu}}$ be a linear differential operator of order $n$ on $\mathbb{R}$ with constant coefficients, where the coefficients $a_{0}, \cdots, a_{n-1}, a_{n} \neq 0$ are complex numbers and $x$ is the coordinate of $\mathbb{R}$. Let $L^{*}=\sum_{\nu=0}^{n}(-1)^{\nu} \overline{a_{\nu}} \frac{d^{\nu}}{d x^{\nu}}$. Prove, by using Plancherel's identity, that there exists a constant $c>0$ which depends only on $M$ and $a_{n}$ and is independent of $a_{0}, a_{1}, \cdots, a_{n-1}$ such that for any $f \in L^{2}(\Omega)$ a weak solution $u$ of $L u=f$ exists with $\|u\|_{L^{2}(\Omega)} \leq c\|f\|_{L^{2}(\Omega)}$. Give one explicit expression for $c$ as a function of $M$ and $a_{n}$.


Hint: A weak solution $u$ of $L u=f$ means that $(f, \psi)_{L^{2}(\Omega)}=\left(u, L^{*} \psi\right)_{L^{2}(\Omega)}$ for every infinitely differentiable function $\psi$ on $\Omega$ with compact support. For the solution of this problem you can consider as known and given the following three statements.

(I) If there exists a positive number $c>0$ such that $\|\psi\|_{L^{2}(\Omega)} \leq c\left\|L^{*} \psi\right\|_{L^{2}(\Omega)}$ for all infinitely differentiable complex-valued functions $\psi$ on $\Omega$ with compact support, then for any $f \in L^{2}(\Omega)$ a weak solution $u$ of $L u=f$ exists with $\|u\|_{L^{2}(\Omega)} \leq c\|f\|_{L^{2}(\Omega)}$.

(II) Let $P(z)=z^{m}+\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} b_{k} z^{k}$ be a polynomial with leading coefficient 1. If $F$ is a holomorphic function on $\mathbb{C}$, then

$$
|F(0)|^{2} \leq \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{\theta=0}^{2 \pi}\left|P\left(e^{i \theta}\right) F\left(e^{i \theta}\right)\right|^{2} d \theta
$$

(III) For an $L^{2}$ function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}$ which is zero outside $\Omega=(-M, M)$ its Fourier transform

$$
\hat{f}(\xi)=\int_{-M}^{M} f(x) e^{-2 \pi i x \xi} d x
$$

as a function of $\xi \in \mathbb{R}$ can be extended to a holomorphic function

$$
\hat{f}(\xi+i \eta)=\int_{-M}^{M} f(x) e^{-2 \pi i x(\xi+i \eta)} d x
$$

on $\mathbb{C}$ as a function of $\xi+i \eta$.","We will use the provided statements (I), (II), and (III) to prove the existence of a weak solution \(u\) of \(L u = f\) with the desired properties.

Let \(\psi \in C_c^\infty(\Omega)\) be an infinitely differentiable function with compact support in \(\Omega\). We want to estimate \(\|\psi\|_{L^2(\Omega)}\) in terms of \(\|L^*\psi\|_{L^2(\Omega)}\). Using Plancherel's identity and statement (II), we have:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\|\psi\|_{L^2(\Omega)}^2 &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} |\hat{\psi}(\xi)|^2 d\xi \\
&\leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} |P(e^{i\theta})\hat{\psi}(e^{i\theta})|^2 d\theta,
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(P(z) = z^n + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} b_k z^k\) is a polynomial with leading coefficient 1, and \(\theta\) is a real variable.

Now, we want to choose \(P(z)\) appropriately to estimate the integral. Let's consider the polynomial \(P(z)\) defined as:

\[
P(z) = (z - a_n)(z - \overline{a_n}),
\]

where \(a_n\) is one of the coefficients of the differential operator \(L\). Since \(L\) is of order \(n\), we have \(a_n \neq 0\). Now, we can rewrite \(P(z)\) as:

\[
P(z) = |a_n|^2 \left(z - \frac{a_n}{|a_n|}\right)\left(z - \frac{\overline{a_n}}{|a_n|}\right).
\]

Now, using statement (II) with \(m = 2\) and \(b_0 = \frac{a_n}{|a_n|}\) and \(b_1 = \frac{\overline{a_n}}{|a_n|}\), we get:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\|\psi\|_{L^2(\Omega)}^2 &\leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} |P(e^{i\theta})\hat{\psi}(e^{i\theta})|^2 d\theta \\
&= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left|P\left(e^{i\theta}\right) \hat{\psi}\left(e^{i\theta}\right)\right|^2 d\theta \\
&= \frac{|a_n|^2}{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left|e^{i\theta} - \frac{a_n}{|a_n|}\right|\left|e^{i\theta} - \frac{\overline{a_n}}{|a_n|}\right| |\hat{\psi}(e^{i\theta})|^2 d\theta.
\end{aligned}
\]

Now, observe that \(\left|e^{i\theta} - \frac{a_n}{|a_n|}\right|\) is the distance between \(e^{i\theta}\) and the complex number \(\frac{a_n}{|a_n|}\), which is a complex constant with magnitude 1. Therefore, \(\left|e^{i\theta} - \frac{a_n}{|a_n|}\right| = 2\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\). Similarly, \(\left|e^{i\theta} - \frac{\overline{a_n}}{|a_n|}\right| = 2\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\).

Substituting these into the inequality, we get:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\|\psi\|_{L^2(\Omega)}^2 &\leq \frac{|a_n|^2}{2\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left(2\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right)^2 |\hat{\psi}(e^{i\theta})|^2 d\theta \\
&= \frac{|a_n|^2}{2\pi} \cdot 4\int_{0}^{2\pi} \left(\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right)^2 |\hat{\psi}(e^{i\theta})|^2 d\theta \\
&= \frac{|a_n|^2}{\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left(\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right)^2 |\hat{\psi}(e^{i\theta})|^2 d\theta.
\end{aligned}
\]

Now, we can apply statement (I) with \(c = \frac{|a_n|^2}{\pi}\) to conclude that:

\[
\|\psi\|_{L^2(\Omega)}^2 \leq \frac{|a_n|^2}{\pi} \|L^*\psi\|_{L^2(\Omega)}^2.
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we have:

\[
\|\psi\|_{L^2(\Omega)} \leq \sqrt{\frac{|

a_n|^2}{\pi}} \|L^*\psi\|_{L^2(\Omega)} = \frac{|a_n|}{\sqrt{\pi}} \|L^*\psi\|_{L^2(\Omega)}.
\]

Now, using statement (I), we can conclude that for any \(f \in L^2(\Omega)\), there exists a weak solution \(u\) of \(L u = f\) with the desired properties:

\[
\|u\|_{L^2(\Omega)} \leq \frac{|a_n|}{\sqrt{\pi}} \|L^*u\|_{L^2(\Omega)} \leq \frac{|a_n|}{\sqrt{\pi}} \|f\|_{L^2(\Omega)}.
\]

Finally, we can choose the constant \(c\) as:

\[
c = \frac{|a_n|}{\sqrt{\pi}}.
\]

So, there exists a constant \(c > 0\) depending only on \(M\) and \(a_n\) such that for any \(f \in L^2(\Omega)\), a weak solution \(u\) of \(L u = f\) exists with \(\|u\|_{L^2(\Omega)} \leq c\|f\|_{L^2(\Omega)}\)."

For which $p \in(1, \infty)$ does $g$ extend to a continuous functional $\bar{g}: L^{p}([0,1]) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ ? For those $p$, what is the norm of this functional?

  \item (AG) Let $X \subset \mathbb{P}^{n}$ be any hypersurface of degree $d \geq 2$, and $\Lambda \subset X \subset \mathbb{P}^{n}$ a $k$-plane in $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ contained in $X$.

  \item Show that if $k \geq n / 2$, then $X$ is necessarily singular.

  \item If $k=n / 2$ and $X \subset \mathbb{P}^{n}$ is a general hypersurface containing a $k$-plane, describe the singular locus of $X$.

  \item $(\mathrm{AT})$
