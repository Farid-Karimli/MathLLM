  \item (Algebraic Topology) (Third Homotopy Group of 2-Sphere). Let $\Phi: \mathbb{C}^{2}-\{0\} \rightarrow \mathbb{C P}^{1}$ be defined by mapping the inhomogeneous coordinates $\left(z_{1}, z_{2}\right)$ of $\mathbb{C}^{2}$ to the homogeneous coordinates $\left[z_{1}, z_{2}\right]$ of the complex projective line $\mathbb{C P}^{1}$.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item (Real Analysis) Let $u(t, x)$ be the solution to the equation
\end{enumerate}

$$
\partial_{t} u(t, x)=\frac{1}{2} u_{x x}(t, x), \quad u(0, x)=f(x)
$$

Suppose $u(t, x)$ is smooth in both $t$ and $x$ and

$$
|u(t, x)|+\left|u_{x x}(t, x)\right| \leq e^{-|x|} .
$$

(a) Prove that there are constants $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ such that

$$
u(t, x)=\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \exp \left[-C_{2} \frac{(x-y)^{2}}{t}\right] f(y) \mathrm{d} y
$$

You can use the formula that the inverse Fourier transform (in $p$ ) of $e^{-t p^{2} / 2}$ is $\frac{C_{1}}{\sqrt{t}} e^{-C_{2} x^{2} / t}$.

(b) From this formula and Holder (or Jensen) inequality, prove the following inequality

$$
\|u(t, \cdot)\|_{L^{2}(\mathbb{R})}^{2} \leq C t^{-1 / 2}\|f\|_{L^{1}(\mathbb{R})}^{2}

Let $G$ be the interior of a closed disk in $\mathbb{R P}^{2}$ whose boundary is $E$. Let $X$ be the space obtained by glueing $T^{2}-D$ to $\mathbb{R P}^{2}-G$ along a homeomorphism between the two circles $C$ and $E$. Compute the fundamental group of $X$ by describing a presentation of it. Then compute the first homology group $H_{1}(X, \mathbb{Z})$ of $X$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$.
