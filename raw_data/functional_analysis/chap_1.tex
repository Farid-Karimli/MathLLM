TOPOLOGICAL VECTOR SPACES Introduction 1.1 Many problems that analysts study arc not primarily concerned with a single object such as a function, a measure, or an operator, but they deal instead with large classes of such objects. Most of the interesting classes that occur in this way turn out to be vector spaces, either with real scalars or with complcx oncs. Since limit processes play a role in every analytic problem (explicitly or implicitly), it should be no surprise that these vector spaces are supplied with metrics, or at least with topologies, that bear some natural relation to the objects of which the spaccs are made up. The simplest and most important way of doing this is to introduce a norm. The resulting structure (defined below) is called a normed vector space, or a normed linear space, or simply a normed space. Throughout this book, the term vector space will refer to a vector space over the complex field $\textstyle{\mathcal{C}}$ or over the real feld R. For the sake of completeness, detailed definitions are given in Section 1.4GENERAL THEORY 1.2 Normed spaces A vector space $\textstyle X$ is said to be a normed space if to every x,in such xe Xthere is associated a nonnegative real number lxl| alled the norm of x $X,$ a way that (a） $\|x+y\|\leq\|x\|+\|y\|$ if $x\in{\mathcal{X}}$ and $\textstyle{\mathcal{A}}$ is a scalar, in $X,$ (c） l $|x||>0$ if $x\neq0.$ for all x nd $\boldsymbol{y}$ (b） $\|\alpha x\|=|\alpha|\ \ \|x\|$ The word $\mathrm{\mathrm{}~^{*}n o r m}^{\prime}$ is also used to denote the function that maps $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{X}}$ to lxl Every normed space may be regarded as a metric space, in which the distance d( $\scriptstyle{\epsilon_{\circ,y}}$ betwccn $\mathbf{\Omega}\cdot{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is $\|x-y\|.$ The relevant properties of ${\boldsymbol{d}}$ are (） $0\leq d(x,y)<\infty$ for all $\textstyle{\mathcal{X}}$ x and ${\mathit{y}},$ (i） $d(x,y)=0$ if and only if $x=y$ (iti） $d(x,\,y)=d(y,\,x)$ for all $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{X}}$ and ${\ {\mathit{y}}},$ (iD) $d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z)$ for all $X,y,\,z.$ In any metric space,the open ball with center at x and radius ${\mathbf{}}T$ is the set $$ B_{r}(x)=\{y\colon d(x,\,y)<r\}. $$ In particular, if T $\textstyle X$ is a normed space, the sets $$ B_{1}(0)=\{x:\|x\|<1\}\qquad{\mathrm{and}}\qquad{\bar{B}}_{1}(0)=\{x:\|x\|\leq1\} $$ are the open wnit ball and the closed uni ball o ${\mathcal{N}},$ respectively By declaring a subset of a metric space to be open if and only if itis a （possibly empty union of open balls, a topology is obtained.(See Section 1.5.）It is quite easy to verify that the vector space operations additon and scalar mutiplication） are continuous in this topology, if the metric is derived from a norm, as above A Banach space is a normed space which is complete in the metric defined by its norm; this means that every Cauchy sequence is required to converge 1.3 Many of the bes-known function spaces are Banach spaces. Let us mention just a few types: spaces of continuous functions on compact spaces; the familiar $L^{p}.$ -spaces that occur in integration theory； Hilbert spaces - the closest relatives o euclidean spaces; certain spaces of differentiable functions; spaces of continuous inear mappings from one Banach space into another; Banach algebras. All of these wil occur later on in the text But there are also many important spaces that do not ft into this famework. Here are some examples: euclidean space (a）C(QD), the space of ll continuous complex functions on some open set $\Omega$ 2 in a $\textstyle R^{n}$ $(b)\ \ H(\Omega),$ the space of all holomorphic functions in some open set Q in the complex plane.TOPoLOGICAL VECTOR SPACES (c） CR,the spaceofalinitel difetiable comple functons o with nonempty interior that vanish outside some fxed compact set $\textstyle R^{n}$ $\textstyle K$ (d） themselves The tet fnctonspaes usd theor o istiuton,a e distibution These spaces crry aural togistha cannot be induced by norms, as we shal elater Tey as ell te normed spaes aecxamies o oiaiec spaces, a concept that pervades all f functional alysis Aferthis riefatmt motivation he a tetaiedeifions olowe Gin Section 1.9) by a preview of some of the results of Chapter 1 ${\boldsymbol{R}}$ or 1.4 Vetor spaes Th lette $\boldsymbol{R}$ and $\textstyle{\mathcal{C}}$ wil alays denot e fel oreal umbers p stand for either $X,$ ${\boldsymbol{C}},$ andthe fld ofcomplex numbers respectively.

A set $Y\subset X$ is called a subspace of $X:\mathbb{F}\ Y$ is itself a vector space (with respect to the same operations, of course).One checks easily that this happens if and only if 0e ${\cal{Y}}$ and $$ \alpha Y+\beta Y c\ Y $$ for all scalars $\textstyle{\mathcal{Q}}$ and ${\boldsymbol{\beta}}.$ $\mathbf{A}$ set $C\subset{\mathcal{X}}$ is said to be convex if $$ t C+(1-t)C\subset C\qquad(0\leq t\leq1), $$ In other words, it is required that ${\boldsymbol{C}}$ should contain $t x+(1-t)y{\mathrm{~if~}}x\in C,y\in C,$ and O $\simeq t\leq1.$ $\mathrm{A}$ set $B\subset X$ is said to be balanced if c $\scriptstyle B\subset B$ for every $x\in\Phi$ with $|\alpha|\leq1.$ A vector space $\textstyle X$ has dimension $\;n$ (dim $X=n)$ if $\textstyle X$ has a basis $\{u_{1},\ldots,u_{n}\}.$ This means that every $X\in X$ has a unique representation of the form $$ x=\alpha_{1}u_{1}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+\alpha_{n}u_{n}\qquad(\alpha_{i}\in\Phi). $$ If dim $X=n$ for some ${\boldsymbol{n}}.$ X is said to have finite dimension、If $X=\{0\},$ then dim $X=0.$ Example If $X=C$ (a one-dimensional vector space over the scalar field C) the balanced sets are: ${\mathcal{C}},$ the empty set ${\mathcal{D}},$ ,and every circular disc （open or closed centered at O.If $X=R^{2}$ (a two-dimensional vector space over the scalar field $\textstyle R\backslash_{!}$ there are many more balanced sets; any line segment with midpoint at $\scriptstyle(0,\,0)$ wil o. The point is that in spite of the well-known and obvious idcntifica- tion of ${\mathcal{C}}$ with $R^{2}.$ these two are entirely different as far as thcir vector space structure is concerned $\mathbf{\hat{e}}_{\infty}$ 1.5 Topological spaces A topological space is a set $\mathbf{S}$ in which a collection t of subsets (called open sets) has been specified, with the following properties: $\boldsymbol{S}$ is open, C is open, the intersection of any two open sets is open, and the union of every collec tion of open sets is open. Such a collection tis called a topology on $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{S}}$ When clarity seems to demand it, the topological space corresponding to the topology r will b written （S, r) rather than ${\boldsymbol{S}}.$ Here is some of the standard vocabulary that will be used,if S and r are as above. A set $\scriptstyle{E\subset S}$ is closed if and onlyif its complement is open. The closure $\overline{{E}}$ E of $\boldsymbol{E}$ is the intersection of all closed sets that contain $E.$ The interior $E^{\circ}$ of E is the unionTOPoLoGICAL VECToR SPACEs of $\textstyle K$ that contains of all open sets that are subsets or $\textstyle{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is thecoecio o llintesecton sct $K\hookrightarrow S$ is compac i evry open cover is any open se then o If l…olo $\overline{{\Gamma}}$ is ue y mti $\ d{\mathrm{~}}$ A neighborhood of a point $\rho\in S$ $V\in\tau,$ ama of a point $E\subset S$ are compatible with each other. $E.$ $\mathbf{A}$ is a base for f vey mber oi with mhsioms is a topology on $E,$ has a finite subcover.

Associate to each ae $X$ and to each scalar $\lambda{\mathcal{H}}^{0}$ the translation operator $\textstyle T_{a}$ and the multiplication operator $\begin{array}{l}{{M_{\lambda}}}\end{array}$ by the formulas $$ T_{a}(x)=a+x,\qquad M_{\lambda}(x)=\lambda x\qquad(x\in X). $$ The following simple proposition is very important Proposition $\textstyle T_{a}$ and $M_{\lambda}$ are homeomorphisms of $\textstyle X$ onto $X.$ that they map $\textstyle X$ Y onto X $X,$ PRoor The vector space axioms alone imply that $\textstyle T_{a}$ and $\varphi_{\lambda{\lambda}}$ are one-to-one. , and that their inverses are $T_{-x}$ and $\ M_{1/\lambda}\,,$ respectively. The assumed continuity of the vector space operations implies tat thesefor mappings are continuous. Hence each of them is a homeomorphism (a con tinuous mapping whosc inverse is also continuous). // invariant (or simply inariant,for brevity)： One consequence of this proposition is that every vector topology ris translation- is open if and only if each of $\mathbf{A}$ set $E\subset X$ its translates $a+E$ is open. Thus ris completely determined by any local base In the vector space context, the term local base will always mean a local base of A mectric $\left(\begin{array}{l l}\end{array}\right)$ at O. A Iocal base of a topological vector space $\textstyle{\mathcal{N}}$ will be called invariant if is thus a collection W of neighbor- The open sets $\textstyle X$ $\textstyle X$ hoos of sch that every neighborhood ofo contains a member of ${\mathcal{Q}},$ ${\mathcal{R}},$ on a vector space are then precisely those that are unions of translates of members of $$ d(x+z,\;y+z)=d(x,\,y) $$ for all $x,y,$ z in $X.$ 1.8 Types of topological vector spaces In the following defnitions, ${\boldsymbol{X}}$ ’ always denotes a tological vector space, with topology r.

Then $\mathbf{0}$ has a neighborhood ${\mathbf{}}V$ $$ (\mathbb{K}+V)\cap(\mathbb{C}+V)={\mathcal{D}}. $$ Note that $K+V\mathbf{i}$ is a union of translates $x+V$ of $V\left(x\in K\right)$ Thus $K+V$ is an that contain $\textstyle K$ and ${\cal{C}}_{,}$ open set that contains K. The theorem thus implies thexistence of disioint open set respectively contexts as well: rRoor We begin wih te following proposition, which wil b seful in other If Wis a neighborhood of O in $X,$ then there is a neighborhood $\scriptstyle U\,d f\,0$ which is symmetric (in the sense that $U=-U)$ and which satisfies $U+U\subset{\mathcal W}.$10 GENERAL THEORY To se this, note that $0+0=0,$ that addition is continuous, and that If $\mathbf{0}$ therefore has ncighborhoods $\gamma_{i},\,\nu_{2}$ such that $V_{1}+V_{2}\subset W.$ $$ U=V_{1}\cap_{\bf\gamma}V_{2}\cap(-V_{1})\cap(-V_{2}), $$ then $U$ has the required properties The proposition can now be applied to $U$ in place of $W$ and yields a new symmetric neighborhood $U_{\mathbf{\delta}}U$ of $\mathbf{0}$ such that $$ U+\,U+U-\,\mathcal{W}. $$ If It is clear how this can be continued $K\ +\ V=\mathcal{D},$ and the conclusion of the theorem is obvious $K=\varnothing,$ then We therefore assume that $K\neq\varnothing,$ and consider a point $x\in K,$ Since ${\boldsymbol{C}}$ 'is closed, since $\textstyle{\mathcal{X}}$ is not in ${\boldsymbol{C}}_{s}$ C, and since the topology of $X$ is invariant under translations, the preceding proposition shows that ( ${\boldsymbol{0}}$ ) has a symmetric neighborhood $V_{\boldsymbol{x}}$ such that $x+V_{x}+V_{x}+V_{x}$ does not intersect ${\mathsf{C}}\,;$ the symmetry of $V_{x}$ then shows that （1） $$ (x+\,V_{x}+\,V_{x})\,\cap\,(C+\,V_{x})=\,\mathcal{D} $$ Since ${\cal K}\,$ is compact, there are finitely many points $X_{1},\ \ x\ \cdot,$ $X_{n}$ in $\textstyle K$ such that $$ K\subset(x_{1}+\;V_{x_{1}})\;\cup\;\cdot\cdot\cdot\cup\;(x_{n}+\;V_{x_{n}}) $$ Put $V=V_{x_{i}}\cap\cdots\longleftrightarrow V_{x_{n}}$ Then $$ K+V\subset\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}+V_{x_{i}}+V)\subset\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}+V_{x_{i}}+V_{x_{i}}), $$ and no term in this last union intersects $C+V.$ by $(\,1\,).$ This completes the proof. $l/{\big/}{\big/}$ $C+V;$ Since $C+V$ is open, it is even true that the closure of $K+V$ does not intersect in particular, thc closure of $K+V$ does not intersect ${\boldsymbol{C}}$ The following special case of this, obtained by taking $\scriptstyle k\cdot\langle0\rangle$ is of considerable interest. 111 Thcorem f1M isa local base or a topologicalvecor space $X$ then every member of !% contains the closure of some member of !M So far we have not used the assumption that every point of $\textstyle X$ is a closed set We now use it and apply Theorem 1.10 to a pair of distinct points in place of ${\cal K}\,$ and ${\cal{C}}.$ The conclusion is that these points have disjoint neighborhoods. In other words,the Hausdorff separation axiom holds: 1.12 Theorem Every topological vector space is a Hausdorff space We now derive some simple properties of closures and interiors in a topological belongs to vector space.

Choose $|\alpha|=1;$ hence $W<\alpha U.$ as in part (a). Since ${\mathcal{W}}$ is $W$ is balanced, an intersection of convex sets, $\scriptstyle A$ d is convex; hence so is $A^{\circ}$ Thus $W\subset{\mathcal{A}},$ which $A^{\circ}$ $\alpha^{-1}W=W$ when t s a neighborhood of O. Clearly $A^{\circ}\subset U.$ Being $A^{\circ}$ of $\textstyle{A}$ To prove that is a neighborhood with the desired properties, we have to show that ${\mathcal{A}}^{\prime}$ balanced; for this it sfices to prove that $\textstyle A$ l is balanced. Choose r and $\beta$ so that $0\leq r\leq1$ $|\beta|=1.$ Then $$ r\beta A=\bigcap_{|\alpha|=1}r\beta\alpha U=\bigcap_{|\alpha|=1}r\alpha U. $$ Since ${\mathfrak{x}}U$ is a convex sct that contains $0_{\mathrm{,}}$ we have $r x U\subset\alpha U.$ Thus $r\beta A\subset A,$ which completes the proof. // Theorem 1.4 can be restated in terms of local bases.

Since $x\in Y,$ no $E_{W}$ is empty. Since inter- $W\in{\mathcal{B}}\}$ section ofinitely many members of W belong to ${\mathcal{B}}_{z}$ ,it follows that $(E_{\mathrm{w}}$ is a collection of compact sets with the finite intersection property. Therefore there exists $z\in\bigcap E_{W}.$ This z lies in ${\cal{Y}}.$ On the other hand, $z\in x+W$ for every $W\in{\mathcal{B}}$ Thus $z=x$ (Theorem 1.12).Hence $x\in\,Y.$ This proves that ${\bar{Y}}=Y,$ $J/f$ and so Yis closed. $X,$ 1.21 Thcorem Suppose $X$ is a complex topological tvector space, Y is a subspace of n is a positive integer, and dim $\textstyle Y=n$ .Then (a)every isomorphism of $Q^{n}$ onto Y is a homeomorphism, and (6) Y is closed. ${\mathcal{C}}^{n}$ The term “homeomorphism”refers, of course, to the euclidean topology of inherits from $\textstyle{X}$ on the other. Since ${\mathcal{C}}^{n}$ on the one hand, and to the topology that ${\cal{Y}}$ is ocally compact, Lemma 1.20 shows that (b） follows from $(\alpha).$ The proof that follows also ields the analogous theorem with real scalars in place of complex ones PROOF $\operatorname{Let}\,P_{n}$ be the theorem as stated. We first prove $\mathbf{\mathcal{P}}_{1}$ Let $\operatorname{A}\!:C\to Y$ be Then $\Lambda\mathcal{X}=\mathcal{\alpha}u.$ an isomorphism Gi.e., a one-to-one linear mapping of ${\boldsymbol{C}}$ onto ${\cal{Y}}\}$ . Put $u=\mathbb{A}|$ $\Lambda$ The continuity of the vector space operations in Yimplies that is continuous. Note that $\Lambda^{-\,1}$ is a linear functional on $\boldsymbol{\mathit{I}}$ with null space {O} a closed set. By Theorem $\mathsf{L.N s},$ $\Lambda^{-1}$ is continuous. This proves $P_{1}$ Assume next that $\scriptstyle n\;{\sim}\;1$ and $p_{n-1}$ is true. Let A: $C^{n}\to Y$ be an isomor- phism. ${\mathrm{Let~}}\{e_{1},\ldots,e_{n}\}$ be a basis of $\sqrt{\gamma}^{\gamma\gamma h}\ _{\bf\Pi}$ the kth coordinate of ${\mathcal{C}}_{k}$ is ${\mathfrak{I}}\,;$ the others are O. Put $u_{k}=\Lambda e_{k}\,.$ for $k=1,\dotsc,n.$ Then $$ \Lambda(\alpha_{1},\,\ldots,\,\alpha_{n})=\alpha_{1}u_{1}\,+\,\cdot\cdot\cdot\,+\,\alpha_{n}u_{n}, $$ and the continuity of the vector space operations in $\boldsymbol{\mathit{I}}$ implies again that $\Lambda$ is continuous. Since $\Lambda$ is an isomorphism, $\{u_{1},\ \cdot\cdot\ ,\ u_{n}\}$ is a basis of ${\boldsymbol{Y}},$ Hence there are linear functionals $\gamma_{1,}\ \cdot\cdot\cdot\ ,\ \gamma_{n}$ on $\boldsymbol{\mathit{I}}$ such that every $x\in Y$ has a unique representation of the form $$ x=\gamma_{1}(x)u_{1}\,+\,\cdot\,\cdot\,\cdot\,+\,\gamma_{n}(x)u_{n}\,. $$ Each y $\gamma_{i}$ assumed truth of $p_{s-1}.$ Hence $\gamma_{i}$ of dimcnsion $n-1,$ which is closed in $\textstyle Y,$ by the has a null space in ${\cal Y},$ is continuous, by Theorem 1.18. Since $$ \Lambda^{-1}x=(\gamma_{1}(x),\ldots,\gamma_{n}(x))\qquad(x\in Y), $$ it follows that $\Lambda^{-1}$ is continuous.

To see another type of example, let us prove that Cauchy seunces are bounded （hence comvergent sequences are bounded)： 1f with $V+V\subset W$ , then [part (b) of Section 1.25] there exists ${\mathbf{}}V$ ’and ${\mathcal{W}}$ are balanced $\boldsymbol{N}$ $\scriptstyle(x_{n})$ is a Cauchy sequence in $X_{\circ}$ and neighborhoods of （ $\mathbf{0}$ such that $x_{n}\in x_{N}+V$ for ${\operatorname{all}}\,n\geq N.$ Take $\operatorname{s>1}$ so that $x_{N}\in s V.$ Then $$ x_{n}\in s V+\ V\subset s V+s V\subset s W\quad\quad(n\geq N). $$ Hence $x_{n}\in t W$ for all $\scriptstyle n\geq1.$ if t is sufficiently large. Also, closures of bounded sets are bounded (Theorcm 1.13) On the other hand, if $x\not\equiv0$ and $E=\{n x\colon n=1,\,2,\,3,\,\ldots\,\}$ , then Eis not bounded, because there is a neighborhood ${\mathbf{}}V$ of O that does not contain x; hence nxis not in $n{\mathcal{V}}$ it follows that no $n\,{\mathcal{Y}}$ contains $\textstyle E.$ Consequently, no subspace of $\textstyle{\bar{X}}$ (other than {0}) can be bounded The next theorem characterizes boundedness in terms of sequences 1.30 Theorem The following two properties of a set E in a topological vector space are equivalent: (a) E is bounded. ${\boldsymbol{E}}$ and $\scriptstyle(x_{n}|$ is a sequence of scalars such that α。→0O as (b) ${\boldsymbol{J}}$ {x,} is a sequence in $\textstyle n\!\to\!\infty$ , then $\alpha_{n}\,\chi_{n} arrow0$ as $n arrow\infty0$ PROOF Suppose $\boldsymbol{E}$ is bounded.

Theorem 1.34 will show that a seminorm p is a norm if it satisfies (c） $p(x)\neq0$ if $x\neq0.$ A family ${\mathcal{P}}$ of seminorms on $\textstyle X$ is said to be separating if to each $x\neq0$ corre- sponds at least one $p\in{\mathcal{P}}{\mathrm{~with~}}p(x)\neq0$ which is absorbing, in the sense that every Next, consider a convex set $A\subset{\mathcal{X}}$ xe X lies in $t A$ for some $l=\iota(x)>0.$ [For example, Ga) of Theorem 1.15 implies that every neighborhood ofC ${\boldsymbol{0}}$ in a topological vector space is absorbing. Every absorbing set obviously contains O. The Minkowski functional $\textstyle\mathit{l}_{A}$ q of $\scriptstyle A$ is defined by $$ \mu_{A}(x)=\operatorname*{inf}\left\{t>0:t^{-1}x\in A\right\}\qquad(x\in X). $$ Note that $\mu_{A}(x)<\infty$ for all $x\in X_{!}$ since $\scriptstyle A$ is absorbing. The seminorms on $\textstyle X$ will turn out to be precisely the Minkowski functionals of balanced convex absorbing sets. Seminorms are closely related to local convexity, in two ways: In every locally convex space there exists a separating family of continuous seminorms. Conversely, if ${\mathcal{P}}$ is a separating family of seminorms on a vector space $\textstyle{X}$ with the property that every $X,$ then ${\mathcal{P}}$ can be used to define a locally convex topology on $p\in{\mathcal{P}}$ is continuous This is a frequently used method of introducing a topology The details are contained in Theorems 1.36 and 1.37. 1.34 Theorem Suppose $\boldsymbol{\mathit{P}}$ is $\textstyle{\mathcal{A}}$ seminorm on $\bar{a}$ vector space $X.$ Then a) p(0) = 0.

Associate to every Ve M its Minkowski functiona $\mu_{\mathrm{{F}}}$ Then $\langle\mu_{V};$ V∈ 9%} is a separating family of continuous seminorms on $X,$ PRO0F Since ${\mathbf{}}V$ is convex, balanced, and absorbing, ${\boldsymbol{\mu}}_{V}$ is a seminorm. $\operatorname{If}\,x\in X$ and $x\not\equiv0_{i}$ then $x\not\in V$ for some $V\in{\mathcal{B}}.$ For this ${\mathbf{}}V$ we have $h_{V}(x)\geq1$ Thus $\scriptstyle\{\mu_{Y}\}$ is a separating family.If $x\in V,$ , then $t x\in V$ for some $\textstyle t>1,$ since ${\mathbf{}}V$ is open. Hence $\mu_{V}<1$ in ${\mathit{V}}.$ If $\ r>0,$ it follows from Theorem 1.34 that $$ |\mu_{\nu}(x)-\mu_{\nu}(y)|\leq\mu_{\nu}(x-y)<r $$ if $x-y\in r V$ . This proves that each ${\boldsymbol{\mu}}{\boldsymbol{\nu}}$ is continuous. // 1.37 Theorem Suppose ${\mathcal{P}}$ P is a separating family of seminorms on a vector space $X.$ Associate to each pe JP and to each positive integer n the set $$ V(p,n)=\left\{x;p(x)<{\frac{1}{n}}\right\}. $$ Let W be the collection of all finite intersections of the sets $\mathcal{V}(p,n)$ .Then ${\mathcal{B}}$ is a convex balanced local base for a topology t on $X,$ which turns $X$ into $\bar{a}$ z locally convex space such that (a) every $p\in{\mathcal{P}}\,,$ is coninuous, amd (b） a set $E\subset X$ is bounded if and only if every $P\in{\mathcal{P}}$ is bounded on $\textstyle E.$ PROOF Declare a set $A\subset X$ to be open if and only if $\textstyle A$ 4 is a (possibly empty) union of translates of members of ${\mathcal{B}}.$ This clearly defines a translation-invariant topology $\overline{{\Gamma}}$ T on $X{\dot{\boldsymbol{r}}}:$ each member of ${\mathcal{A}}$ Bis convex and balanced, and ${\mathcal{A}}$ is a local base for r. Suppose $x\in N,\,x\ \tau=0$ Then $p(x)>0$ for some $P\in{\mathcal{P}},$ Since $x:{\mathfrak{s}}$ not in $V(p,n)$ if $n p(x)>1,$ we see that $\mathbf{0}$ is not in the neighborhood $x-V(p,n)$ of $X_{\textstyle}$ so that $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{X}}$ is not in the closure of {0}. Thus {y} is a closed set, and since t is translation-invariant, every point of $\textstyle{X}$ ’is a closed set Next we show that addition and scalar multiplication are continuous.

Thus $\tilde{p}$ is well defined on $X/N,$ and it is now easy to verify that $\tilde{P}$ j is a norm on $X/N.$ $|0,1\rangle$ for which $r,\ 1\leq r<\omega;$ let ${\boldsymbol{L}}^{\prime}$ be the space of all Here is a familiar cxample of this.

Since $p_{1}\leq p_{2}\leq\cdots,$ the sets (2） $$ V_{n}=\left\{f\in C(\Omega)\colon p_{n}(f)<\frac{1}{n}\right\}\qquad(n=1,\,2,\,3,\,\ldots) $$ topology of form a convex local base for $c(\Omega).$ According to remark（c) of Section 1.38, the $C(\Omega)$ is compatible with the metric (3） $$ d(f,g)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\,\frac{2^{-n}p_{n}(f-g)}{1+p_{n}(f-g)}. $$ If proved hat $c(\mathbf{a})$ is a Cauchy sequence relative to this metric, then $p_{n}(f_{i}-f_{j})\to0$ for every n,as $^{\left\{f\right\}}$ $i,j\to\varnothing,$ so that $^{\left\{J\right\}}$ converges uniformly on $K_{n}\,$ . to a function fe C(Q).An easy computation then shows $d(f,f_{i})\to0$ Thus $\ d$ is a complete metric.We have now is a Fréchet space. By $\mathbf{\nabla}(b)$ of Theorem 1.37, a set $E\subseteq C(\Omega)$ is bounded if and only if there are numbers $M_{n}<\infty$ such that p,f） ≤ M,for all fé E;explicitly, (4） $$ |f(x)|\leq M_{n}\qquad\mathrm{if}f\in E{\mathrm{~and~}}x\in K_{n} $$ no $V_{n}$ Since every $V_{n}$ contains an f for which $p_{n+1}(f)$ is as large as we please,it follows that is bounded. Thus $C(\Omega)$ is not locally bounded, hence is not normable. 1.45 The spaces $H(\Omega)$ Let $\mathbb{Q}$ now be a nonempty open subset of the complex plane, define $c(\Omega)$ as in Section 1.44, and Iet H(Q) be the subspace of $C(\Omega)$ that con- sists of the holomorphic functions in $\mathbb{Q}$ 2. Since sequences of holomorphic functions that converge uniformly on compact sets have holomorphic limits, $\scriptstyle I(\Omega)$ is a closed subspace of C(Q2).Hence $H(\Omega)$ is a Freéchet space. We shall now prove that $I({\boldsymbol{\Omega}})$ has the Heine-Borel property It will then follow from Theorem 1.23 that $H(\Omega)$ is not locally bounded, hence is not normable. Let $\boldsymbol{E}$ be a closed and bounded subset of $H(\Omega).$ Then $\boldsymbol{E}$ satisfies inequalities such as $(\lambda)$ of Section 1.44. Montel's classical theorem about normal families (Th. 14.6 of [23]) implies therefore that every sequence $\{f_{i}\}\subset E$ has a subsequence that con- verges uniformly on compact subsets of Q [hcncc in thc topology of H(Q)] to somc fe H(D).Since ${\boldsymbol{E}}$ is closed, fe E. This proves that ${\boldsymbol{F}}$ is compact. 1.46 The spaces $C^{\infty}(\Omega)$ and ${\mathcal{D}}_{K}$ We begin this section by introducing some terminology that will be used in our later work with distributions In any discussion of functions of n variables, the term multi-index denotes an ordered ${\boldsymbol{\pi}}^{\prime}$ tuple (1） $$ {\mathcal{x}}=(\alpha_{1},\ \cdot\cdot,\ \sigma_{n}) $$ 'Numbes racetsrer ores idi he BibiographyrorouooucAL VrcroR sePAcs 3 operator of nonnegatve integer $\propto_{i}$ wWith each mult-inde $\textstyle{\mathcal{Q}}$ is associated te difentia (2） $$ D^{\alpha}=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}}\right)^{\alpha_{1}}\cdot\cdot\cdot\left(\frac{\hat{g}}{\hat{g}x_{n}}\right)^{\alpha_{n}} $$ whose order is (3) $$ |\alpha\,|=\alpha_{1}+\cdots+\alpha_{n}. $$ If $|x|=0$ ，,D* =/ ${\mathcal{G}}.$ my oulspeos soc is sa to belong to $C^{\infty}(\Omega)$ Aompeolfiso fne nsmenemtyopene $\Omega\subset R^{n}$ $\{x;f(x)\neq0\}.$ if Dye COD for evey mt-ne J" wy…o… settin $K_{i+1}$ and is a compact set i $\textstyle R^{n}\!,$ then ${\mathcal{D}}_{K}$ dcnots e spaeo ll / C(KR" whos whenever $K\subset\Omega.$ If $\textstyle K$ interior of support lies in K.(The lette ${\mathcal{D}}$ has e so tspsevesecsenwa into a Freche space wih lies in the subspace of $C^{\alpha}(\Omega).$ published his work on istonsS》 ${\mathcal{A}}_{K}$ is a clsed suhspace o $C^{\infty}(\Omega)$ may be identifed with a $K\subset\Omega$ 、then ${\mathcal{Q}}_{K}$ We mow define ology on $\Omega=\cup K_{i}$ Define seminorms $(i=1,\,2,\,3,\,*.\,)$ on $C^{\infty}(\Omega),$ $N=1,$ 2,3,.., b the Heine-Bore propery, snchiha $C^{\infty}(\Omega)$ which makes $C^{\infty}(\Omega)$ $K_{i}$ To do thi chse comat s $K_{i}$ such that ${\mathcal{P}}_{N}$ (4） $$ p_{N}(f)-\operatorname*{max}\,\{\,|D^{x}f(x)|\,;\,x\in K_{N},\,|x|\leq N\}. $$ remark this topology.

The same conclusion holds for < has nonempty interior (otherwise ${\mathcal{Q}}_{K}=\{0\},$ case. This last statement is a consequence of the following proposition: there exists $\phi\in C^{\infty}(R^{n})$ such that $\phi(x)=1$ for every $x\in B_{1}$ and in the interior of $\scriptstyle{B_{2}}$ , then $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{X}}$ 1f B, and $B_{2}$ are concentric closed balls n $R^{n},$ with $B_{1}$ for every $\phi(x)=0$ outside $B_{2}$ To find such a $\phi_{i}$ ， we construct $g\in C^{\infty}(R^{1})$ such that G(x).= 0 for $x<a,g(x)=1$ for $x>b$ （where $0<a<b<\infty$ are preassigned) and put (6) $$ \phi(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})=1-g(x_{1}^{2}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+\,x_{n}^{2}). $$ The following construction ${\mathfrak{o t}}{\mathfrak{g}}$ has the advantage that suitable choics of {,} can lead to functions with other desired properties.

Suppose $\Lambda:I^{p}\to Y$ is a continuous linear mapping of ${\boldsymbol{J}}^{p}$ P into some locally con- vex space Y.
