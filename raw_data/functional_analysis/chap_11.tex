The terminology of the preceding chapter wil be used without change.

Partially order ${\mathcal{P}}$ by set inclusion, let $\textstyle{\mathcal{Q}}$ totally ordered subcollection of ${\mathcal{P}}$ (the existence of ${\mathcal{Q}}$ is assured by Hausdorff's maximality theorem), and let $\bar{M}$ T be the union of all members of ${\mathcal{Q}}.$ Being the union of a toally ordered collcton of idcals, $\ M$ 1 is an ideal. Obviously $J\subset M,$ and $M\neq A$ since no member of ${\mathcal{O}}$ contains the unit of $\textstyle{\mathcal{A}}$ The maximality of $\mathcal{Q}$ implies that $\bar{M}$ is a maximal ideal of $\textstyle{\mathcal{A}}$ element of (6） Supposc $\bar{M}$ is a maximal ideal in $A.$ Since $\bar{M}$ contains no invertible contains $\textstyle A$ and since the set of ll nvertible elements is open, $\overline{{M}}$ no invertible element either. Thus $\overline{{M}}$ is a proper ideal of $A.$ and the maximality of $\bar{M}$ shows therefore that $M={\widetilde{M}}.$ // 11.4 null space or kernel of $\phi~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ Homomorphisms and quotient algebras $A/J$ is a Banach space, with respect to the $\pi\colon{\mathcal{A}}\to A/J$ is the Banach algcbras and $\phi$ is obviously an ideal in ${\cal A},$ If $\textstyle A$ and ${\boldsymbol{B}}$ are commutative is a homomorphism o $\dot{A}$ into $\boldsymbol{B}$ (see Section 10.4) then the Conversely, suppose $\boldsymbol{\jmath}$ is a proper closed ideal in , which is closed if d and $\phi$ is continuous. $\scriptstyle A$ quoticnt map, as in Definition 1.40. Then quotient norm (Theorem 1.41).We will show that $A/J$ is actually a Banach algebra and that r is a homomorphism. If $x^{r}-x\in J$ and $y^{\prime}-y\in J,$ uhe identity (1） $$ x^{\prime}y^{\prime}-x y=(x^{\prime}-x)y^{\prime}+x(y^{\prime}-y) $$ shows that $x^{\prime}y^{\prime}-x y\in J;$ hence $\pi(x^{\prime}y^{\prime})=\pi(x y).$ Multiplication can therefore be unambiguously defined in $A/J$ by (2) $$ \pi(x)\pi(y)=\pi(x y)\qquad(x\in A,y\in A). $$ $\mathrm{{It}}$ is then easily verified that $A/J$ is a complex algebra and that r is a homomorphism Since $\|\pi(x)\|\leq\|x\|,$ by the definition of the quotient norm, r is continuous.CoMMUTATVE BANACH ALGEBRAS 265 Suppose $x_{i}\in C$ A $(i=1,2)$ and $\delta>0$ .

Since $$ (x_{1}+y_{1})(x_{2}+y_{2})\in x_{1}x_{2}+J, $$ we have (4） $$ \|\pi(x_{1}x_{2})\|\leq\|(x_{1}+y_{1})(x_{2}+y_{2})\|\leq\|x_{1}+y_{1}\|\,\|x_{2}+y_{2}\|, $$ so that O) implies the multiplicative inequality (5） $$ \|\pi(x_{1})\pi(x_{2})\|\le\|\pi(x_{1})\|\,\|\pi(x_{2})\|\,. $$ x∈ A, Finally,ife is the unit element of ${\bar{A}},$ ,then (2) shows that Since $\|\pi(x)\|\ \leq\ \|x\|$ for every $A/J,$ and since $\pi(e)\neq0,\;($ S) shows that $\|\pi(e)\|\geq1=\|e\|$ $\scriptstyle\pi(\epsilon)$ is th unit o $\|\pi(e)\|=1$ This completes the proof.

Choose $x\in A,\;x\notin M,$ and put (1） $$ \cdot J=\{a x+y\colon a\in A,y\in M\}. $$ Then $\boldsymbol{J}$ is an ideal in $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{A}}$ which is largcr than $M,$ since xe J.(Take $a=e,y=0.$ $\mathcal{M}$ Thus $J=A,$ ,and ax + 9 = e for some of $A/M$ onto ${\bar{C}}.$ Put $h=j\circ\pi.$ Then $h\in\Delta,$ and algebra there is an isomorphism $j$ $a\in A,y\in M$ If ${\mathfrak{:}}\pi\colon A\to A/M$ is the quotient $A/M$ is therefore invertible in $A/M.$ Every nonzero element r(xy of the Banach map,it follows that $\pi(a)\pi(x)=\pi(e).$ By the Gelfand-Mazur theorem, is the null space of h266 BANACH ALGEBRAS AND SPECTRAL THEORY (b) If $h\in\Lambda_{!}$ then $h^{-1}(0)$ is an ideal in $\scriptstyle{A}$ which is maximal because it has codimension ${\textbf{I}},$ (c) If xis invertible in $\textstyle A$ and $h\in\Delta,$ then $$ h(x)h(x^{-1})=h(x x^{-1})=h(e)=1, $$ so that $h(x)\neq0.$ If xis not invertible, then the set {ax: $a\in A\}$ does not contain e, hence is a proper ideal which lies in a maximal one (Theorem 11.3) and which is therefore annihilated by some $h\in\Delta,$ because of $(a).$ (d) No invertible element lies in any proper ideal. The converse was proved in the proof of $(c).$ in place of $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{X}}$ // (e) Apply (c) to $\lambda e-x$ Our first application concerns functions on $\textstyle R^{n}$ that are sums of absolutely convergent trigonometric series.

For each $X,$ the evaluation $f\to f(x)$ is a complex homomorphism of $A.$ The assumption about the given function $\boldsymbol{\mathit{f}}$ is that no evaluation annihilates it. If we can prove that $\dot{A}$ has no other complex homomorphisms, Cc of Theorem ll.5 will imply that fis invertible in ${\bar{A}},$ which is exactly the desired conclusion For $r=1.$ ….，n, put $g_{r}(x)=\exp\,(i x_{r}),$ where $x_{r}$ is the rth coordinate of $X.$ Then ${\mathcal{O}}_{r}$ , and $\textstyle{\sum}\not\varrho_{r}$ are in $\scriptstyle A$ and have norm 1. If $h\in\Delta,$ it follows from (c) of Theorem 10.7 that $$ |h(g_{r})|\le1\qquad\mathrm{and}\qquad\left|\frac{1}{h(g_{r})}\right|=\left|\left.h (\frac{1}{g_{r}}\right)\right|\le1. $$ Hence there are real numbers ${\mathbf{}}y_{r}$ , such that (3) h(g,)= exp (iy,) = 9,0) (1 ≤r≤n) where y = 0,…，y).

Since $\dot{\boldsymbol{h}}$ is continuous on $\textstyle{\mathcal{A}}$ (Theorem $10.7)$ is evaluation at ${\mathbf{}}y_{*}$ and since the set of all trigonometric polynomials is dense in $\textstyle A$ (as is obvious // from the definition of the norm),(4) implies that $h(f)=f(y)$ for every fe A. and the proof is complete.

In particular, this is true of every automorphism of a semisimple commutative Banach algebra.The topology of such an algebra is therefore completely determined by its algebraic structure In Theorem 1.9, the algebra $\hat{\cal A}$ may or may not be closcd in $C(\partial)_{i}$ with rcspect to the supremum norm. Which of these cases occurs can be decided by comparing $\|x^{2}\|$ with $\|{\boldsymbol{X}}\|^{2};$ , for all $x\in A$ .Recall that $\|x^{2}\|\leq\|x\|^{2}$ is always true. 11.11 Lemma If A is $\overline{{a}}$ commutative Banach algebra and (1) $$ r=\mathrm{inf}\frac{\|x^{2}\|}{\|x\|^{2}},\qquad s=\mathrm{inf}\frac{\||\hat{x}|\|_{\infty}}{\|x\|}\qquad(x\in A,\,x\neq0), $$ then. $s^{2}\leq r\leq s$ PROOF Since ISllo≥s llxH (2） $$ \|x^{2}\|\geq\|{\hat{x}}^{2}\|_{\infty}=\|{\hat{x}}\|_{\infty}^{2}\geq s^{2}\|x\|^{2} $$ for every $x\in A$ Thus $s^{2}\leq r$ Since $\|x^{2}\|\geq r$ lxl for every $x\in A,$ induction on $\;n$ shows that (3) $$ \|x^{m}\|\geq r^{m-1}\,\|x\|^{m}\qquad(m=2^{n},\,n=1,\,2,\,3,\,\ldots,). $$ Take mth roots in 3) and let $m arrow\infty\,.$ By the spectral radius formula and （c) of Theorem 11.9, (4) $$ \|{\hat{x}}\|_{\infty}=\rho(x)\geq r\|x\|\ \ \ \ \ \ (x\in A). $$ Hence $r\leq s$ 11.12 Theorem Suppose $\scriptstyle A$ is ${\mathcal{A}}_{}$ i commutative Banach algebra (a) The Gelfand transform is an isometry (that $i{\mathcal{S}},$ $\|x\|=\|{\hat{x}}\|_{x}$ for every $x\in A)$ $i f$ and only $i f\left\|x^{2}\right\|=\left\|x\right\|^{2}$ for every $x\in{\mathcal{A}}$ (b） A is semisimple and $\bar{A}$ is closed in C(A) if and only if there exists K<Oo such that llxll $<K\Vert x^{2}\Vert$ for every x∈ A.

We shall now give some cxamples to illustrate this. (a) Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorf space, put $A=C(X),$ , with the supremum of $\textstyle X$ norm. For $\operatorname{each}x\in X,f\to f(x)$ is a complex homomorphism $h_{x}\neq h_{y}.$ Thus $x\to h_{x}$ cmbeds $\textstyle X$ in $\Delta$ in ${\mathsf{C}}(X)$ which contains, for each $p\in X,$ I contains finitely many functions ${\mathcal{f}}_{1},$ $h_{x}\,.$ Since C(X) separates $\bar{M}$ points on X (Urysohn's lemma), $x\neq y$ implies We claim that each $h\in\Delta$ is an $h_{x}\,.$ ..If this is false, there is a maximal ideal implies then that $\bar{M}$ a function $f\operatorname{with}f(p)\neq0.$ The compactness $\ast\cdot\cdot J_{n}$ such that at least one of them is ${\overline{{\gamma}}}(0)$ at each point of $X.$ Put $$ g=f_{1}\bar{f}_{1}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+f_{n}\bar{f}_{n}. $$ Then $g\in M,$ since $\bar{M}$ is an ideal; $\scriptstyle g\;>\;0$ at every point of $X{\mathrm{:}}$ ; hence $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{G}}$ is invertible in C(X) But proper ideals contain no invertible elements Thus $x rightarrow h_{x}$ is a one-to-one correspondence between $\textstyle X$ and $\Delta$ and can be used to identify $\Delta$ A with $\textstyle X$ This identification is also correct in terms of the two topologies ${\mathsf{C}}(X)$ that are involved: The Gelfand topology y of $\textstyle X$ is the weak topology induced by $\scriptstyle\gamma$ is a Hausorf topology: yand is therefore weaker than t, the original one, but $\scriptstyle\gamma$ hence $\gamma=\tau.$ $\mathrm{[See~}(a)$ of Section 3.8.] and the Gelfand trans- summing up X“is" the maximal dal space o $C(X),$ form is the identity mapping on C(X). (b) Let $\scriptstyle A$ be the algcbra of all absolutely convergcnt trigonomtric series, as in Section 11.6. We found there that the complex homomorphisms are the evalua- tions at points of $\textstyle R^{n}.$ Since the members of $\textstyle A$ are 2zr-periodic in each variable, $\Delta$ is the torus $T^{n}$ obtained from $\textstyle R^{n}$ by the mapping $$ \big(x_{1},\ \cdot\cdot\cdot\ ,\ x_{n}\big) arrow\big(e^{i x_{1}},\ \cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\,\rlap/e^{i x_{n}}\big). $$ This is an example in which $\hat{\cal A}$ is dense in $C(\Delta),$ although ${\hat{\lambda}}\neq C(\Delta)$ (c) In the same way, the proof of Theorem 11.7 contains the result that ${\bar{U}}^{n}$ is the maximal ideal space of $A(U^{n}).$ The argument used at the end of (a) shows that ; the the natural topology of $U^{n}$ is the same as the Gelfand topology induced by ${\mathit{d}}({\widehat{U}}^{n})$ same remark applies to (b).

Under pointwise multiplication, this is obviously a commuta tive Banach algebra $\mathbb{F}\in L^{\infty}(m)$ and ${\cal G}_{f}$ is the union of all open sets ${\bar{0}}\subset{\mathcal{Q}}$ with $m({f}^{-1}(G))=0,$ then the complement of $\sigma(J)$ o ${\mathfrak{f}}_{f},$ hence with the range of its Gelfand transform.、It follows ${}^{'}\!f\!\!\!\in\!\rangle$ is easily seen to coincide $G_{f}$ (called the essential range of with the spectrum tha $\operatorname{it}{\hat{f}}$ is real if fis real.

Thus m(Q) > 0if Q is open and nonempty Since Assume next that $\phi~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$ is a Borel function on $\Delta,$ $|\phi|\leq1.$ By Lusin's theorem $L^{2}({\hat{m}})$ $f{\boldsymbol{\mapsto}}f$ [23] there are functions ${\tilde{f}}_{n}\in C(\Delta)$ $|\hat{f}_{n}|\leq1,$ that converge to $\phi$ in the norm of preserves complex conjugation (as we saw above) and is a homomorphism, it follows from （10), applied to $(f_{i}-f_{j})({\bar{f}}_{i}-{\bar{f}}_{j}),$ that (11) $$ \int_{\Delta}|\hat{f}_{i}-\hat{f}_{j}|^{2}\,d\hat{m}=\int_{0}^{1}|f_{i}-f_{j}|^{2}\,\,d m. $$ Thus conclusion is that $\phi=f$ $\mathrm{that}\,f_{n}{\to}f\mathrm{in~}L^{2}(m),$ and now (11） implies $\mathrm{that}\,\hat{f}_{n} arrow\hat{f}$ a.e.

Indeed, if x and $\mathbf{\nabla}y$ commute with every se S,so do .x, $x+y,$ and xy;since multi- plication is continuous in $A,\Gamma(S)$ is closed. This proves $(a).$ Since every se Scommutes with every xe T(S),(b) holds. If $\mathbf{\SS}$ commutes, then ${\mathbf{S}}\subset\Gamma({\mathbf{}}S).$ hence $\Gamma(S)\equiv\,\Gamma(\Gamma(S)).$ which proves （Cc), since T(E) obviously commutes whenever $\Gamma(E)\subset E.$ 11.22 Theorem Suppose Ais a Banach algebra $S\subset A.$ $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{S}}$ commutes, and B = for erery T(F(S)) Then Bis a commuiauive Banach algebra, ${\mathcal{S}}\subset B$ , and $\sigma_{B}(x)=\sigma_{A}(x)$ $x\in B$ PROOF Since $e\in B_{s}$ Section 11.21 shows that $\boldsymbol{B}$ is a commutative Banach algebra that contains S. Suppose $x\in B$ and $\mathbf{\Omega}\lambda_{1}^{\lambda}$ is invcrtiblc in ${\mathcal A}$ Wc havc to show that $x^{-1}\in B.$ Since $x\in B,$ $x y=y x$ for every $y\in\Gamma(S).$ ; hence $y=x^{-1}y x,$ // $y x^{-1}=x^{-1}y$ . This says that $x^{-1}\in\Gamma(\Gamma(S))=B.$ 11.23 Theorem Suppose $\dot{A}$ is a Banach algebra, $x\in A,\;y\in A.$ ,and $x y=y x$ Then $$ \tau(x+y)\subset\sigma(x)+\sigma(y)\qquad a n d\qquad\sigma(x y)\subset\sigma(x)\sigma(y). $$ PROOF Put $S=\{x,y\};$ put $B=\Gamma(\Gamma(S))$ Then $x+y\in B,\,x y\in B,$ and Theorem 11.2 sows that we have to prove that $$ \sigma_{B}(x+y)\subset\sigma_{B}(x)+\sigma_{B}(y)\qquad\mathrm{and}\qquad\sigma_{B}(x y)\subset\sigma_{B}(x)\sigma_{B}(y). $$ Since $\boldsymbol{B}$ is commutative, $\sigma_{a}(z)$ is the range of the Gelfand transform ${\hat{\mathbb{Z}}},$ for every $\scriptstyle{\varepsilon\in G}$ (The Gelfand transforms are now functions on the maximal ideal space of B.) Since $$ cdot(x+y){}^{\star}={\hat{x}}+{\hat{y}}\qquad{\mathrm{and}}\qquad(x y)^{\star}={\hat{x}}{\hat{y}}, $$ we have the desired conclusion. $J/f$coMMUTATTVE BANACH ALCEBRAs 281 Corollay $J{\cal f}\,C_{x}=R_{x}-L_{x},$ aS ${\mathit{i n}}\,$ Section 10.37, then $\sigma(C_{x})\subset\sigma(x)-\sigma(x)$ the algebra ${\mathcal{R}}(A),$ PRoor If the theorem is appied to the commuting clements $\textstyle R_{x}$ and $-L_{\alpha}$ of the conclusion is $$ \sigma(C_{x})\subset\sigma(R_{x})-\sigma(L_{x}). $$ But $\sigma(R_{x})=\sigma(x)=\sigma(L_{x}).$ / then $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{X}}$ 11.24 Definition Let A be an algebra with an involution.1 $\operatorname{f}x\in A$ and $x x^{*}=x^{*}x_{;}$ is said to be normal. A set ${\mathcal{S}}\subset{\mathcal{A}}$ is said to be normal if $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{S}}$ commutes and if $x^{*}\u S$ whenever $x\in S.$ 11.25 Theorem Suppose A isa Banach algebra withan involution, and $\boldsymbol{B}$ is a normal subset of Athat is maximal wihrespect to being normal. Then (a) B is a closed commutatitre subalgebra of A, and (b) $\sigma_{B}(x)=\sigma_{A}(x)f o r\;e v e r y\;x\in B.$ .Note that the involution is not assumed to be continuous but that $\boldsymbol{B}$ neverthe less turns out to be closed. PROOF We begin with a simple criterion for membership in ${\boldsymbol{B}}\colon$ B:：Ifx∈ A,if xx* $=x^{*}x,$ and if xy = yx for every $y\in B,$ , then $x\in B$ for all $y\in B_{i}$ For if $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{X}}$ x satisfies these conditions, we also have $x y^{*}=y^{*}x$ since $\boldsymbol{B}$ is normal, and therefore $x^{*}y=y x^{*}$ .t follows that $B\cup\{x,\,x^{\bullet}\}$ is normal. Hence $x\in B,$ since $\boldsymbol{B}$ is maximal This criterion makes it clear that sums and products of members of ${\boldsymbol{B}}$ B are in ${\boldsymbol{B}}.$ Thus $\boldsymbol{B}$ is a commutative algebra_ Suppose $x_{n}\in B$ and $x_{n}\to x.$ Since $x_{n}y=y x_{n}\operatorname{for}\operatorname{all}y\in B,$ and multiplica tion is continuous, we have $x y=$ yx and thcrcfore also $$ x^{\ast}y=(y^{\ast}x)^{\ast}=(x y^{\ast})^{\ast}=y x^{\ast}. $$ In particular, $\chi^{\ast}x_{n}=\chi_{n}\,\chi^{\ast}$ for all n, which leads to $\chi^{\mathrm{st}}\chi=\chi\chi^{\mathrm{st}}.$ Hence $x\in b.$ by the above criterion. This proves that $\boldsymbol{B}$ is closed and completes $(a).$ normal, so is Note also that e∈ B. To prove (b), assume $x\in B,$ $x^{-1}\in A$ Since xis ${\mathcal{X}}^{-1},$ and since $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{X}}$ commutes with every $y\in B,$ so does $x^{-1}$ Hence $x^{-1}\in B$ Our frst application of thsis a generalization of Theorem $1\mid.20;$ 11.26 Theorem The word $\mathbb{Z}\mathbb{C}$ commutatie” may be dropped from the hypothesis of Theorem 11.20.282 BANACH ALOEBRAs AND srCTRAL THEoR、 PROOF By Hausdorff's maximality theorem. the given hermitian hence normaD $J/I\!f$ xe A lies in some maximal normal set in place of $A.$ By Theorem 11.25 we can apply ${\boldsymbol{B}}.$ Theorem 11.20 with $\boldsymbol{B}$ Our next application of Thcorem 11.25 will extend some consequences o -algebras Theorem 11.18 to arbitrary Gnot neessrily commutative $B^{\ddagger}.$ 11.27 Definition In a Banach algebra with involution,the statement $^*x\geq0^{\prime\prime}$ means that $x=x^{*}$ and that $\sigma(x)\subset[0$ , cO). 11.28 Theorem Every B*-algebra $\textstyle A$ has the following properies (a) 1lermitian elements have real spectra.
