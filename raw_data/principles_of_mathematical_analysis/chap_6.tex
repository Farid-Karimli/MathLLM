THB RIEMAN-STiELTJEBS INTEORAL 123 The integral depends on f,α,a and ${\overline{{\mathcal{D}}}}_{9}$ but not on the variable of integration, which may as well be omitted The role played by the variable of integration is quite analogous to that of the index of summation: The two symbols $$ \sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i},\qquad\sum_{k=1}^{n}c_{k} $$ mean the same thing, since each means $c_{1}+c_{2}+\,\cdot\,\cdot\,\cdot\,+\,c_{n}\,.$ Of course, no harm is done by inserting the variable of integration, and in many cases it is actually convenient to do so. We shall now investigate the existence of the integral （T). Without saying so every time, f will be assumed real and bounded, and a monotonically increas ing on [a, b]; and, when there can be no misunderstanding, we shall writefir place 6.3 Definition We say that the partition ${\boldsymbol{P}}^{\star}$ is a refinement of P if P* = P (that is, if every point of $\bar{\cal M}$ $\textstyle P_{1}$ and P, is a point of P*). Given two partitions, F we say that P* is their common refinement if $P^{*}=P_{1}\cup P_{2}$ 6.4 Theorem If P* is a refinement of P,then (10) $$ \begin{array}{c l c r}{{{\cal L}(P,f,\alpha)\leq{\cal L}(P^{*},f,\alpha)}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{U(P^{*},f,\alpha)\leq U(P,f,\alpha).}}\end{array} $$ (9） and Proof To prove （9),suppose first that ${\mathcal{P}}^{\star}$ contains just one point more than P.

Before we apply it, we state some closely related facts. 6.7 Theorem (a）I(13) holds for some $\widehat{\cal P}$ and some s, then （13) holds （with the same e） for every refinement of P (b） If（13) holds for $P=\{x_{0}\,,\,\cdot\,\cdot\,,\,x_{n}\}$ and if s;， ${\Big\langle}{\Big\rangle}_{\hat{l}}$ are arbitrary points in Lxr-1, x., then $$ \sum_{i=1}^{n}|f(s_{i})-f(t_{i})|\,\,\Delta\alpha_{i}<\varepsilon. $$ (c）If f∈ SW(c) and the hypotheses of (b) hold, then $$ \left|\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(t_{i})\Delta a_{i}-\int_{a}^{b}f\ d x\right|<\varepsilon. $$ Proof Theorem 6.4 implies (a).Under the assumptions made in（b) both f(s) and f(t) lie in [m;，M;], so that |f(S,）一f(t)≤ M;- m,.Thus $$ \begin{array}{l c r}{{\binom{n}{\displaystyle i=1}}\{f(s_{i})-f(t_{i})|\,\,\,\Delta x_{i}\leq U(P,f,\alpha)-L(P,f,\alpha),}}\end{array} $$ which proves (b).

If c is a pure step function [this is the name often given to functions of the form（22)], the integral reduces to a finite or infinite series. If α has an integrable derivative the integral reduces to an ordinary Riemann integral. This makes it possibl in many cases to study series and integrals simultaneously, rather than separately To illustrate this point, consider a physical example. The moment or inertia of a straight wire of unit length, about an axis through an endpoint, at right angles to the wire, is (33） $$ \textstyle{\int_{0}^{1}}x^{2}\,d m $$ where m(x) is the mass contained in the interval [O,x]、If the wire is regarded as having a continuous density p,that is, if m′(x) = p(x), then (33) turns into (34) $$ \textstyle\int_{0}^{1}x^{2}\;\rho(x)\;d x. $$ On the other hand, if the wire is composed of masses ${\mathcal{N}}_{i}$ concentrated at points x,,(33） becomes (35) $$ \sum_{i}x_{i}^{2}\,m_{i}. $$ Thus (33） contains (34) and （35) as special cases, but it contains much more; for instance,the case in which m is continuous but not everywherc differentiable. 6.19 Theorem (change oft variabe）Suppose p is a strictly increasing contimwows function that maps an interval [A,B] onto [a, b].

The mean value theorem furnishes points t,∈ [X:-1, X] such that $$ F(x_{i})-F(x_{i-1})=f(t_{i})\ \Delta x_{i} $$ for i= 1,...,n.Thus $$ \displaystyle{\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(t_{i})\,\Delta x_{i}=F(b)-F(a).} $$ It now follows from Theorem 6.7(c) that $$ \left\vert F(b)-F(a)-\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,d x\right\vert<\varepsilon. $$ Since this holds for every e> 0, the proof is complete. 6.22 Theorem （integration by parts）Suppose ${\mathcal{F}}^{\prime}$ and G are differentiaoble func- tions on [a,b], ${\boldsymbol{F}}^{\prime}$ =fe O,and $\scriptstyle G\neq g\gamma$ E 92.Then $$ \textstyle\int_{a}^{b}\!F(x)g(x)\,d x=F(b)G(b)-F(a)G(a)-\int_{a}^{b}\!f(x)G(x)\,d x. $$ Proof Put H(x） = F(x)G(Xx) and apply Theorem 6.21 to $\textstyle H$ and its deriv ative. Note that ${\bar{H}}^{\prime}$ ∈ S,by Theorem 6.13.THE RIEMAN-sTILTEs NTEGRAL 135 INTEGRATION OF VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS 6.23 Definition Let f,...,./ be real functions on [a,b], and let f= (f,...,人 be the corresponding mapping of [a,b] into R*. If α increases monotonicall on [a, b], to say that f∈ SR(α) means that f,e SP(α) for j= 1,...,k.If this is the case, we define $$ \textstyle{\int_{a}^{b}}\mathbf{f}\,d x=\left(\int_{a}^{b}f_{1}\,d x,\,\ldots,\int_{a}^{b}f_{k}\,d x\right). $$ In other words, f dox is the point in $\textstyle{\mathcal{R}}^{k}$ whose jth coordinate is [f, dα It is clear that parts (a),(C), and (e) of Theorem 6.12 are valid for these vector-valued integrals; we simply apply the earlier results to each coordinate The same is true of Theorems 6.17,6.20,and 6.21.To illustrate, we state the analogue of Theorem 6.21. 6.24 Theorem Iff and F map [a, b] into $R^{k},$ iff∈ Jt on [a,b], and if F’= f, then $$ \textstyle\int_{a}^{b}\!f(t)\;d t=\operatorname{F}(b)-\operatorname{F}(a). $$ The analogue of Theorem 6.13(b) offers some new features, however, at least in its proof. 6.25 Theorem If t maps [a, b] into $\textstyle{\mathcal{R}}^{k}$ Rt and if f∈ 82(o) for some monotonically increasing function α on [a,b], then |fl e SR(c), and (40) $$ \left|\int_{a}^{b}{}_{b}\,d\alpha\right|\leq\int_{a}^{b}\left|\xi\right|\,d x. $$ Proof If f,… f are the components of f, then (41） $$ |\mathbb{F}|=(f_{1}^{2}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+f_{k}^{2})^{1/2}. $$ By Theorem 6.11, each of the functions f belongs to SR(α); hence so does their sum. Since x $\chi^{2}$ is a continuous function of x, Theorem 4.17 shows that the square-root function is continuous on [O,M], for every real $\mathcal{M}$ If we apply Theorem 6.11 once more,（41) shows that |fle OI(a） y = f dox, and To prove (40), put y =（y+, …， x) where y, = ,/, d. Then we have $$ |\mathbf{y}|^{2}=\sum y_{i}^{2}=\sum y_{j} \|f_{j}\,d x=\int(\sum y_{j}f_{j})\,d x. $$ By the Schwarz inequality, (42） $$ \sum y_{j}f_{j}(t)\leq|{\mathrm{y}}|\,|{\mathrm{f}}(t)|\quad\quad(a\leq t\leq b); $$136 PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS hence Theorem 6.12(6) implies (43) lyl ≤|y「ifl d If y = 0,(40) is trivial. If y ≠ 0, division of(43) by lyl gives（40) RECTIFIABLE CURVES We conclude this chapter with a topic of geometric interest which provides ar application of some of the preceding theory. The case k = 2 (i.e.,the case of plane curves)is of considerable importance in the study of analytic functions of a complex variable 6.26 Definition A continuous mapping y of an interval [a, b] into $\textstyle{\mathcal{R}}^{k}$ is calle a curve in R*. To emphasize the parameter interval [a,b], we may also say that y is a curve on Ja,b1. If y is one-to-one, y is called an arc If y(a) = 2(b),y is said to be a closed curve. It should be noted that we define a curve to be a mapping, not a point set. Of course, with each curve y in $\textstyle{\mathcal{R}}^{k}$ there is associated a subset of R',namely the range of y,but different curves may have the same rarge. We associate to each partition $P=\{x_{0}\,,\,\ldots,\,x_{n}\}$ of [a, b] and to each curve y on [a, b] the number $$ \Lambda(P,\gamma)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}|\gamma(x_{i})-\gamma(x_{i-1})|. $$ The ith term in this sum is the distance (in R') between the points y(X:-1) and y(x)、 Hence A(P,y)is the length of a polygonal path with vertices at (xo) yix,.……，x),in tis order.As our partition becomes finer and finer, thi polygon approaches the range of y more and more closely. This makes it seem reasonable to define the length of yas $$ \Lambda(\gamma)=\operatorname{sup}\,\Lambda(P,\,\gamma), $$ where the supremum is taken over all partitions of [a,b]. If A(y)<Oo, we say that y is rectifiable. In certain cases,A(y) is given by a Riemann integral. We shall prove this for coninuouly difeniable curves, i., for curves y whose derivtive y'is continuous.THE RIEMANN-STlELTJES INTEGRAL 137 6.27 Theorem If’is continuous on [a,b], then y is rectifiable, and $$ \Lambda(\gamma)=\int_{a}^{b}|\gamma^{\prime}(t)|\;d t. $$ Proof 1f $a\leq x_{i-1}<x_{i}\leq b,$ then Hence $$ |\gamma(x_{i})-\gamma(x_{i-1})|=\left|\right|_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i}}\gamma^{\prime}(t)\,d t |\leq\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i}}|\gamma^{\prime}(t)|\,d t. $$ $$ \Lambda(P,\,\gamma)\,\leq\,\int_{a}^{b}|\gamma^{\prime}(t)|\,\,d t $$ for every partition $\underline{{{\iint^{3}}}}$ of [a, b]. Consequently, $$ \Lambda(\gamma)\leq\int_{a}^{b}|\gamma^{\prime}(t)|\ d t. $$ To prove the opposite inequality,let &> 0 be given.Since’is uniformly continuous on [a,b], there exists > 0 such that $$ |\,\gamma^{\prime}(s)-\gamma^{\prime}(t)|<\varepsilon\qquad\mathrm{i}\mathrm{f}\ |s-t|<\delta. $$ Let $P=\{x_{0}\,,\,\ldots,x_{n}\}$ be a partition of [a,b], with $\Delta x_{i}<\delta$ for all i. If Xi-1 S1≤ $X_{i}\,.$ ;,it follows that Hence ly(t)|≤「y'(x) + e. $$ \begin{array}{r l}{\prime(t)|\,d t\leq\left|\,\gamma^{\prime}(x_{i})\right|\,\Delta x_{i}+\varepsilon\,\,\Delta x_{i}}\\ {\ }&{{}=\left|\int_{x_{i}-1}^{x_{i}}\gamma^{\prime}(t)+\gamma^{\prime}(x_{i})-\,\gamma^{\prime}(t)\right|\,d t |+\varepsilon\,\Delta x_{i}}\\ {\leq\left|\,\int_{x_{i}-1}^{x_{i}}\gamma^{\prime}(t)\,d t\right|+\left|\int_{x_{i}-1}^{x_{i}}\left|\gamma^{\prime}(x_{i})-\gamma^{\prime}(t)\right|\,d t\right|+\varepsilon\,\,\Delta x_{i} | |+\varepsilon\,\Delta x_{i}\,,}\end{array} $$ If we add these inequalities, we obtain Since s was arbitrary $$ \begin{array}{r l}{\int_{a}^{b}|\gamma^{\prime}(t)|\,d t\leq\Lambda(P,\gamma)+2s(b-a)}\\ {\leq\,\Lambda(\gamma)+2s(b-a).}\end{array} $$ $$ \int_{a}^{b}\left|\gamma^{\prime}(t)\right|\,d t\leq\Lambda(\gamma). $$ This completes the proof138 PRINCTPLES OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIs EXERCISES 1.
