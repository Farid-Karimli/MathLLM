## Finite-Dimensional Spaces

1.19 Among the simplest Banach spaces are $R^{n}$ and $\mathscr{C}^{n}$, the standard $n$-dimensional vector spaces over $R$ and $\phi$, respectively, normed by means of the usual euclidean metric: If, for example,

$$
z=\left(z_{1}, \ldots, z_{n}\right) \quad\left(z_{i} \in \mathscr{C}\right)
$$

is a vector in $\mathscr{C}^{n}$, then

$$
\|z\|=\left(\left|z_{1}\right|^{2}+\cdots+\left|z_{n}\right|^{2}\right)^{1 / 2}
$$

Other norms can be defined on $\varnothing^{n}$. For example,

$$
\|z\|=\left|z_{1}\right|+\cdots+\left|z_{n}\right| \quad \text { or } \quad\|z\|=\max \left(\left|z_{i}\right|: 1 \leq i \leq n\right)
$$

These norms correspond, of course, to different metrics on $\phi^{n}$ (when $n>1$ ) but one can see very easily that they all induce the same topology on $\mathbb{C}^{n}$. Actually, more is true.

If $X$ is a topological vector space over $\mathscr{C}$, and $\operatorname{dim} X=n$, then every basis of $X$ induces an isomorphism of $X$ onto $\mathscr{C}^{n}$. Theorem 1.21 will prove that this isomorphism must be a homeomorphism. In other words, this says that the topology of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ is the only vector topology that an $n$-dimensional complex topological vector space can have.

We shall also see that finite-dimensional subspaces are always closed and that no infinite-dimensional topological vector space is locally compact.

Everything in the preceding discussion remains true with real scalars in place of complex ones.
