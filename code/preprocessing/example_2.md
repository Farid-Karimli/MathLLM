2.18 Definition Let $X$ be a metric space. All points and sets mentioned below are understood to be elements and subsets of $X$.

(a) A neighborhood of $p$ is a set $N_{r}(p)$ consisting of all $q$ such that $d(p, q)<r$, for some $r>0$. The number $r$ is called the radius of $N_{r}(p)$.

(b) A point $p$ is a limit point of the set $E$ if every neighborhood of $p$ contains a point $q \neq p$ such that $q \in E$.

(c) If $p \in E$ and $p$ is not a limit point of $E$, then $p$ is called an isolated point of $E$.

(d) $E$ is closed if every limit point of $E$ is a point of $E$.

(e) A point $p$ is an interior point of $E$ if there is a neighborhood $N$ of $p$ such that $N \subset E$.

(f) $E$ is open if every point of $E$ is an interior point of $E$.

(g) The complement of $E$ (denoted by $E^{c}$ ) is the set of all points $p \in X$ such that $p \notin E$.

(h) $E$ is perfect if $E$ is closed and if every point of $E$ is a limit point of $E$.

(i) $E$ is bounded if there is a real number $M$ and a point $q \in X$ such that $d(p, q)<M$ for all $p \in E$.

(j) $E$ is dense in $X$ if every point of $X$ is a limit point of $E$, or a point of $E$ (or both).

Let us note that in $R^{1}$ neighborhoods are segments, whereas in $R^{2}$ neighborhoods are interiors of circles.
